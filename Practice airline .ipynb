I\\'m on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm? @VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag @VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt @VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you. @VirginAmerica why can\\'t you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness @VirginAmerica you\\'re the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I\\'m delayed and Late Flight :( @VirginAmerica I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness @VirginAmerica it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin @VirginAmerica I’m having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? http://t.co/pX8hQOKS3R @VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up? @VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday . @VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin @VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn\\'t a great user experience.  Time for another redesign. @VirginAmerica I can\\'t check in or add a bag. Your website isn\\'t working. I\\'ve tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y @VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable @virginamerica What is your phone number. I can\\'t find who to call about a flight reservation. @VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone. @VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax @virginamerica how\\'s a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky @VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp. @VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm @VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I\\'m trying to check in and I\\'m getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info. @VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a \"tech stop\"? @VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn\\'t have a cross-browser compatible website? @VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem? @VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370 @VirginAmerica i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!! @VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check. @VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry @VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you! @VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless @VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise @VirginAmerica why can\\'t we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated @VirginAmerica You\\'d think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame @VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it\\'s on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas @VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :( @VirginAmerica question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It\\'s not giving me the option but we want a seat for him. .@VirginAmerica I don\\'t understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy. .@VirginAmerica does that mean you don\\'t have a policy for destroyed luggage? @VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait. @VirginAmerica How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out! @VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site @VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable. @VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We\\'re stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2) @virginamerica why don\\'t any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter @VirginAmerica is the website down? @VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2 @VirginAmerica I\\'m disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers @VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh @VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?! @VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher... @VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven\\'t heard back and I\\'m flying this week #disappointed @VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don\\'t even respond to your cudtomers @VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me? @VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks! @VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline? @VirginAmerica a lot of \"apologies\" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever. @VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever @VirginAmerica trying to book a flight with you guys and your website won\\'t let me... about to lose my business @VirginAmerica you suck! @VirginAmerica Just DM\\'d.

Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink. @VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flights today? No precipitation to be scared of!  ❄️❄️❄️ @VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What\\'s the deal? @VirginAmerica can’t access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook. @VirginAmerica your mobile site is broken, shows \\n\"{{header.elevateUser.numOfPointsAvailable || \\'0\\' | number}} Points\", won\\'t let me checkin @VirginAmerica I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin @VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flight VX413?

Cost me $800 ...ugh @VirginAmerica I was so looking forward to my first flight with you today but it was Cancelled Flightled along with the subsequent one ... @VirginAmerica  how are you gonna have a deal from Dallas to DC but no deal from DC to Dallas? #sad @VirginAmerica hold times at call center are a bit much @VirginAmerica Site down? #help @VirginAmerica Trying to reset my password, email never arrives. Help? @VirginAmerica What is the reason  for the delay of the departure of VX 413 from JFK this afternoon? @VirginAmerica is todays flight from Palm Springs, Ca to JFK in NY Cancelled Flightled? @VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable. @VirginAmerica We\\'re on flight 910 Vegas to Boston today, checked in online but our bag count didn\\'t register. Can I fix that somehow? @VirginAmerica Hi, I\\'m trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues @VirginAmerica - the passenger in 7D, Flt 338 that assaulted me shouldn\\'t have flown. I trust he\\'s banned. Crew filed report to @FAANews @VirginAmerica current bug on website shows ‘select departure city’ when selecting destination city http://t.co/SLLYIBE2vQ @VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn\\'t any help. @VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver member😒 @VirginAmerica #wtf I paid for direct flight on purpose not to have to stop for fuel exhausted frequent flier and nothing for inconvenience! @VirginAmerica there is something wrong with you website in Safari iPhone @VirginAmerica Already checked in so the page expired :X @VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place! @VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. \"Better seat\" is cabin select not behind the row I selected👎 #DISAPPOINTED @VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help @VirginAmerica Is there anything going on with the website? I\\'ve been getting a lot of errors past 30 minutes. @VirginAmerica @VirginAtlantic I have just checked in flight to SFO from LAX &amp; been told as Atlantic Flying Club Gold I get no benefits?! @VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome! @VirginAmerica soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-) @VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this! @VirginAmerica I\\'m trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it\\'s not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS @VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr @VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I\\'m calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff @VirginAmerica The Flight Booking Problems section of your website seems to be broken on Chrome. Might wanna look into that. @virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD @virginamerica the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me https://t.co/2pUJvCElNg @VirginAmerica can\\'t check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW @virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW @VirginAmerica WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550? @VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I\\'ve filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage. @VirginAmerica I requested a mileage challenge for status several weeks ago online but haven\\'t heard back. How do I get help with this? @VirginAmerica Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll keep trying :) @VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly 😥 @VirginAmerica trying to check-in...but looks like your site is down? @VirginAmerica spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home! @VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers. @VirginAmerica seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may??? @VirginAmerica It\\'s fine. Already done with my purchase. But you should try it. Just go most of the way through then go back 3 @virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board @VirginAmerica\\nwjere is our luggage #so slow at lax @VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well @VirginAmerica I am deeply disappointed that your birthday promo was not applied to a trip I booked mere days before I received the email @VirginAmerica what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome @VirginAmerica I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. \\nhttp://t.co/3fq3XElbOn @VirginAmerica on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards. @VirginAmerica on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline. @VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn\\'t work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks! @VirginAmerica delayed to10.30!! @VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation? @VirginAmerica Comenity Bank is a joke!  Please change.  Nothing but constant problems with this bank @VirginAmerica, I submitted a status match request a while back and still haven’t heard! I’m flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate? @VirginAmerica I\\'m pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn\\'t work on iPhone or iPad.don\\'t have a computer #help @VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It\\'s been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you! @VirginAmerica I cannot even open my laptop in seat 4C and I paid a premium for this?!!   Let me out of here! @VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!! @VirginAmerica FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn\\'t exist. Emails bounce. @VirginAmerica Status match - 2 weeks have gone by and no news.Flt next week - hope flt will count towards requirement.  Cust Svc no help!!! @VirginAmerica your website sucks donkey dicks. Just thought you should know. All best. @VirginAmerica all crap channels which is why I pay to watch UK tv @VirginAmerica how come you don\\'t have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper. @VirginAmerica Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that  have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail @VirginAmerica When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :( @VirginAmerica sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns! @VirginAmerica kinda sucked my earphone jack didn\\'t work on my flight. They may want to look into that for future passengers @VirginAmerica Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego. @VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time. @VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well? @VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn\\'t carry them on plane or lock bag. @VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row! @VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1) @VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I\\'ve been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes.......... @VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together. @VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too. @VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me. @VirginAmerica While other airlines weren\\'t Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck! @VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again! @VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I\\'m shocked at Virgin\\'s complete apathy toward their customers. @VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer? @virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)…tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees. @VirginAmerica mood lighting on point🙌 Reclining my seat, kickin up my feet💤 @VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay? @VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can\\'t because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 😡 @united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant\\'s trip. @united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there\\'s a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united @united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :) @united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so. @united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock. @united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade. @united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can\\'t transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service @united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous! @united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it\\'s a necessity for my child @united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united @united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting @United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner. @united thats weak. See ya 👋\\nHey @VirginAmerica !! @united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight @united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab @united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I\\'d like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me. @united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue. @united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn\\'t pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled @united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#\\'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy @united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but... @united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn\\'t take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice @united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB @united yes, we\\'ve been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice. @united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer @united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad @united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient @united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it\\'s an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child @United well sitting on the ground \\'on time\\' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis @united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It\\'s not a concern, I\\'ll just travel with someone else moving forward. @united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable @united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It\\'s been a while. @united rude rude @united - Why can\\'t I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec @united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback @united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn\\'t even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service... @United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome @united Shame that there\\'s no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn\\'t enough! @united No. Denver said they don\\'t handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either. @united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes @united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told \"we can\\'t find a supervisor.\" @united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn\\'t helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me. @united I will not be flying you again @united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I\\'m arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight. @united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX. @united v upset with your disability  \"services\". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude. @united thnx for quick reply but don\\'t think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today. @united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who\\'s active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!! @united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!! @united as a 1k, I\\'m always hoping for improvement. @united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope? @united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can\\'t find a supervisor for help. @united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It\\'s expensive to get right . @united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come. @united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!! @united silly I\\'m flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk @united What is your phone number. I can\\'t find who to call about a flight reservation. @united well, you can\\'t fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it. @united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn\\'t? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did. @united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12 @united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm. @united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog! @united what\\'s the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn\\'t read them? (Continued) @united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys @united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds! @United. What\\'s going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever @united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours! @united crashed trying to check in. @united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system! @united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam @united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out. @united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08 @united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail! @united ok it\\'s now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service @united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice @united What\\'s going on with your website? I\\'m Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I\\'ve been booted off the system umpteen times. @united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable? @united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one. @united @simonroesner you\\'ll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it\\'s like sitting on a concrete bench. @united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling @united but it\\'s hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse. @united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it\\'s a hollow one. It\\'s obvious that you don\\'t care about me or my well-being, @united This isn\\'t a one time thing either! It\\'s a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect. @united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you @united It\\'s an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine. @united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this. @united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought @united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR. .@united it will be because I\\'m moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service @united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better. @united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United. @united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error @united Yeah sorry but there\\'s always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems. @united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused @united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling. @united so you\\'re telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff? @united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived. @united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now @united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice @united So they didn\\'t drop my bag overnight &amp; now I\\'m leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag.... @united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today. @united not able to DM you my confirmation number @united I\\'ve sent the message, let me know if you got it. I\\'m not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs? @united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service! @united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks! @united common!! keep your paper work ready and don\\'t delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago @united yep that\\'s correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn\\'t matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx @united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know @united I\\'m grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me? @united I\\'m so frustrated and nervous because of this. @united are the ones who make it difficult for me. @united I\\'m not a child. I\\'m someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You @united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off? @united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you? @united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn\\'t next to him? @united I\\'m seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication @united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :( @united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted? @united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that\\'s not an option. @united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The @united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE. @united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher @united ok. To top things off, you\\'ve lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines @united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel @united maybe one day you\\'ll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC @United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously??? @united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2) @united I hadn\\'t filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2) @united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We\\'re pretty curious #UnitedAirlines @united hence why I\\'ve been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out @united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage @united according to your DMs, I\\'m not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim @united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere. @united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr @united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes.... @united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN @united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can\\'t eat. @united it was UA flight 1001! Now I\\'m currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome @united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines @united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka @united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I\\'d have it back yesterday! @united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn\\'t be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight @united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning??? @united completed form but doubt it\\'s any use. UA doesn\\'t care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won\\'t feel responsibility for that... @united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room... @united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back! @united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money.. @united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United. @united It\\'s still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here. @united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk! @united   It\\'s too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight. @united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery? @united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can\\'t leave! #FAIL @united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required @lindaSWC @united:  We don\\'t like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ. @united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1. @united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage. @united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online... @united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing... @united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!! @united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do @united plus what about food? And taxis? @united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL @united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing @united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you\\'re having a good night. Thanks. @united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail @united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer. @united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines @united Thanks; might want to fix this line: \"Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days.\" @united it\\'s frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket. @united at its worse. Can\\'t figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go! @united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6 Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier @united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they\\'d call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they\\'re waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail @united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here. “@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx @united good to know you will open the closed doors for \"premier passengers\" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed. @united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It\\'s bullshit. @united If it\\'s any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights. @united that\\'s unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture @united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it. @united Yes. Doesn\\'t make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn\\'t change the fact that I\\'m very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight. @united I\\'m constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B @united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away. @united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room @united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today\\'s flight? @united agent split up my reservation? Now can\\'t Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why @united why would they make me share a room? @united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we\\'d miss options anyway @united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please? @united we\\'re still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth @united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund @united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please. @united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United @united it\\'s highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement @united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear \\'call corp\\' @united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like @united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city @united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let\\'s find these bags. @united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible \"provide a death certificate\\' policy @united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn? @United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you! @united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW! @united thanks for effing up our holidays - we\\'re missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team\\'s incompetence at @FlyYOW @united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am. @united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous. @united Not encouraged that I\\'ll have my CPAP tonight. @united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery @united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies?? @united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it\\'s on time again with 20 min to spare? Don\\'t say it\\'s delayed unless you\\'re sure! @united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD. @united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let\\'s not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable. @united has once again let me down. Don\\'t think I\\'ve ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period. @united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement. @united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet! @united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool @united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack? @united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich. @united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet @united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help? @united @AmericanAir so that\\'s it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this! @united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I\\'m asking for all 50 people to be refunded. @united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don\\'t get it. How can I charge devices? @united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going @united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks @united I\\'m very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures. @united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That\\'s just ridiculous keep people updated! @united Soooo, it\\'s been 15 days and you\\'ve offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now? @united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2) @united It\\'s taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update? @united That\\'s correct—I\\'ve spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2) @united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers. @united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas? @united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful. @united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there\\'s no such thing as an emergency takeoff. @united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour. @united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn. @united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased? @united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board @united GRK13575M is the file reference @united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot! @united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably. @united Been trying since 1230 to file a report. @united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I\\'ll never fly with you again. @united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee @united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it\\'s illegal to use a used car seat @united: I don\\'t care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a \"wrong\" price on your site—it\\'s your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness. @united He needs to get to home the 24th, they\\'re telling him it\\'ll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done? “@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP” what\\'s the point of membership? @united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime @united Dmed you. Thank you @united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story @United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh. @united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you\\'ve lost it at O\\'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating! @united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag? @united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help @united what\\'s a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday? @united where\\'s my damn bag?? @united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!! @united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it\\'s way to MSY. If you only had people that cared @united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can\\'t help rebook. #friendlyskies? @united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS @united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies?? @united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho. @united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS @united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH. @united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example. @united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise. @United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother @united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That\\'s how @Delta would handle. @united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver @united So you are inadequate by accident? @united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN @united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can\\'t help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR @united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd @united ...and when that doesn\\'t work... @united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn\\'t find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can\\'t use them. @united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags. @united That\\'s not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag\\'s location is. @united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here @united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing. @united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever! @united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened. @united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I\\'m waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked. @united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change @united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways @United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM @SouthwestAir doesn\\'t charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious \"costs\" that you incur, @united? @united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s @united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I\\'m not a rookie. Read my bio. @united I\\'ve never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable @united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc. @United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines @united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage\\'s lost and there\\'s no help but argument! @united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver @united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry. @united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet @united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets? @united but if i tweet the ID number, won\\'t that reveal my home address to anyone on the web? @united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere! @united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet @united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i \"have\" to fly with you. @united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472 @united I did... no response back @united this is atrocious customer service. @united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice @united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why? @united @dfpietra THAT\\'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology @united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated @united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague. @united is the worst airline in the world. @united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management. @united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry. @united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited @united I will but right now I\\'m to angry @united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines @united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail @united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair @united I\\'m saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around @united I think DM would be better @United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly @united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone\\'s personal possessions &amp; you couldn\\'t care less!.... @united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly @united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive.. @united once united\\'s service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again @united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst @united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable @united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home @united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude. @united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines. @united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people @united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper. @united I\\'m trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted. @united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine! @united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter. @united @campilley hahaha. If they weren\\'t an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!! @united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley 😃😃😃 @united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?! @united It\\'s a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService @united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset. @united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help? @united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN. @united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement. @united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can\\'t be placed in 2000 characters? @united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER @United We\\'ve been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb @united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked. @united Can\\'t leave the Tarmac ..united\\'s gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited @united That\\'s real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don\\'t fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I\\'ve had over the past 6 mos. @United blocked me from DM\\'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum @united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can\\'t redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere. @united We\\'ve had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that? @united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston @united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible. @united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn\\'t ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out. @united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I\\'ve never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass. @united I\\'m rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep. @united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour! @united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder. @united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx @united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns @united Heads up We didn\\'t check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren\\'t claim #s for our 2. Other people\\'s bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD @united This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you...\" @united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though. @united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them. @united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted. @united well that\\'s big of you but I don\\'t have terribly high expectations at this point. @united it\\'s like you\\'re trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that\\'s never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿 @united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not @united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I\\'ll have to stay overnight? @united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired. @united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won\\'t change our flight. Can we go now? @united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap @united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice @united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up. @united I\\'d thank you - but you didn\\'t help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn\\'t actually helpful @united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven\\'t left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse? @united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles! @united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous @united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence. @united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j @united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T @united don\\'t see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early @united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option @united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn\\'t broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints @united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes? @united Thanks! I\\'ll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don\\'t like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better @united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ @United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don\\'t understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent. @united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now? @United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are @united I wasn\\'t asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit @United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it\\'s 1:05 and we haven\\'t moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense @united go to hell @united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don\\'t u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed @united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights @united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO! The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned. @united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I\\'ve used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable! @united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts @united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse @united we\\'ve been here since 3am and you\\'ve Cancelled Flightled our flight twice @united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396 @united UA5396 can wait for me. I\\'m on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap. @united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I\\'m getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK @united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight @united is there a United gold number? I\\'ve been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help. @united noooooooooooooooooooooope. @united Oh, we are sure it\\'s not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it\\'s usually the only YYJ flight that\\'s Cancelled Flightled daily. @united it\\'s not getting any better. I\\'d suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people @united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi. @united already missed  connection ugh @united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft. @united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help! @united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info. @united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We\\'re on the outdoor track for an hour @united - SERIOUSLY it\\'s 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You\\'re the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no \\'unwind\\' BS. @united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again @united you\\'re the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare @united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve @united that\\'s not even an apology @united that\\'s cool - now what? @united - SERIOUSLY it\\'s 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You\\'re the ONLY airline without WiFi... @united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv @united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can\\'t even take a walk without missing a change. @united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room @united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine. @united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother? @united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that\\'s unsafe? STUNNING @united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation? @united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back! @united In 2015, United is \"unable\" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice @united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981 @united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can\\'t figure it out! awesome service... NOT! @united\\nYou really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake! @united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to \"sick pilot\". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care. @united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I\\'m a mileage plus card member 😔 @united We\\'re hoping to hear from you actually. @united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for \"maintenance\" it could be the same issue 2day @united It\\'s the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what\\'s going on other than \"maintenance\". @united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn\\'t a Cancelled Flightled a flight. @united a) she\\'s an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out. @united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags @united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven\\'t. @united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi @united I\\'d say most of the public can\\'t extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can\\'t honor? @united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. \"No crew\".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to \"get to NY to catch @AirCanada\" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead. @united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don\\'t believe verbal or written confirmations from United @united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don\\'t have an electronic ticket @united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime @United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight\\'s worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G @united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt @united  gate agent at EWR \" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it\\'s time to board, please step\". STEP UP??? Lol @united it won\\'t help...been there done that. @united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals @united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag @united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal @united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over @united 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap @united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt. @united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR @united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too? @united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter\\'s flt?? What\\'s going on? Follow me so I can dm details. @united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again). @united was that English? I\\'ll DM though I don\\'t think you\\'ll make a plane appear. @united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don\\'t you fly to SBA? 😭 @united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks @united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we\\'re very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h? @united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation? @united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I\\'ve already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines @united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!! @united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting! @united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once. @united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!! @united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed. @united Why isn\\'t the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board @united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better.. @united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help! @united you suck.    9 hour delay?! @united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down. @united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes. @united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed! @united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn\\'t police the overhead bins? @united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won\\'t be able take wet clothes to the airport @united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN\\'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER! @united still no response?? @united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me @united There is no \"reference number.\" Your agent told me to \"just drive to the airport\" because \"I can\\'t reach anyone there to deliver...\" @united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops. @united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you. @united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed? @united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives? @united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you\\'re not that bad! @united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!! @united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way @united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr? @united no they aren\\'t - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE @united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines) @united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants. @united space. Doctors\\' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united @united \\'s new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead @united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac! @united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule... @united 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!  Taking my 1K status to @AmericanAir #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE @united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues @united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone. @united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help @united working with Lisa J at ORD. she\\'s working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR. @united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I\\'m still irritated w/ united. @united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I\\'d be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help! @united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor. @united at this point I made it home on my own. @united I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.\\nJ @united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I\\'m at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place. @united it wasn\\'t a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response @united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that\\'s it! @united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR @united how about starting without the robotic response? @united You can\\'t control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here. @united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I\\'ve ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck. @united yes, but it\\'s not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR @united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice @united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500 @united I\\'m on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService @united as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail @united day 3 of this Saga maybe they\\'ll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice @united No, thanks. I\\'m sick of your company\\'s lousy excuse for customer service. I\\'m never flying United again. @united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online? @united I understand ppl make mistakes but don\\'t code something in a way that we can\\'t get reimbursed when it\\'s YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE @united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection. @united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it\\'s our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy .@united Not what\\'s been shared by the pilot with passengers! @united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu @United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF. @united they\\'re not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful. @united I\\'m not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse! @united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn\\'t work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning @united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US? .@united You may \"dislike delays\" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time. @united #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay @united I\\'m aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit @united Making sure your flights aren\\'t delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start. @united hilarious @united hahahahaha ya tried that already @United \"Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages.\" @united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool @united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm @united wasn\\'t trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee @united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere @united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again. @united you\\'ve been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching! @united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together @united @ShowExpert what is going on with United\\'s Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit? @united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool. UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation. @united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight @united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats... @united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it\\'s fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly @united - it\\'s been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end? @united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight @united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending. @united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house @united I guess you have to \"follow\" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won\\'t send. @united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback @united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked? @united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage? @united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to \"check in\" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa @united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight. @united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever @united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff @united - 75% of a plane\\'s passengers boarding in your \"Premier\" groups might be an indication of a broken process. @united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it\\'s totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it\\'s Cancelled Flightled, again. @united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet @united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH @united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please. @united literally sucks @united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS @united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable. @united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really? @united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket @united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised.... @united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting? @united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable @united it\\'s 430am and wife still doesn\\'t have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail @united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM? @united you are terrible. @united I\\'m glad you didn\\'t mean to, but it doesn\\'t excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight @united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a \\'error\\' message. I hope you didn\\'t still charge me. @united … But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR @united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 … @united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.) @united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too. @united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won\\'t be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how\\'s that for patience? @united @DelonGerry ual sucks @united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace! BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines @united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke @united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue @united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (\"uplink prob\"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate? @United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United @united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage. @united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You\\'re the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service! @united doesn\\'t help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight. @united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That\\'s after 9 hour delay. @united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1 @united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz @united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER????????? @united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional. @united that\\'s why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons @united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why... @united that\\'s why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate @united also didn\\'t ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs. @united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn\\'t have a gate agent once we got a gate. @united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That\\'s how much they value my time?? @united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity @united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving? @united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ @united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet @united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted @united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher? @united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night \"as fast as they can\", you should reconsider what you think that means. @united It\\'s the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United @united why do you want me to be loyal  if don\\'t let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead @united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach. @united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck. @United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united @united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence @united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever @united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn\\'t I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx @united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u @united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment? @united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded @united I\\'m desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD @united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip. @united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn\\'t that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx @united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info. @united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it! @united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars @united will lose my bag but won\\'t give me free pretzels #frauds @united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS @united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter @united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved! @united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century! @united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor?? @united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold. @united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic @united love how you don\\'t give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I\\'ve stayed away @united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error). @united it will be on a different airline. @united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved. @united clicked \"upgrade now\" and it didn\\'t upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59 @united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can\\'t be book. spent over 2 hours with united support @united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can\\'t be book! @united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2 @united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around. @united Flight 472 from ORD couldn\\'t let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2 @united i need help but in spanish @united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn\\'t wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online @united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them? @united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground... @united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight... @united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore? @united worst flights I\\'ve ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN @united customers aren\\'t dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think @united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi @united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That\\'s not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA @united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier @united compensate us for new clothes bet you won\\'t @united, we\\'re stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =) @united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving @united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams @united I tried the online tracking and they said something like \"attempting to locate luggage\" @united your worker told us not to call because we\\'d be talking to someone in Thailand... @united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven\\'t received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here. @united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do @united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united @united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus? @united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections @united if you don\\'t like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much? @united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay @united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS @united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read \\'ya we\\'ll change that so our customers get better service\\' @united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc. @united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business. @united I can\\'t find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight? @united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn\\'t address the issue! @united that\\'s not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back @united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed. @united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail @united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice @united I did. It took about an hour and a half though @united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn @united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =( @united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M @united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn\\'t let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa @united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can\\'t even describe. @united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won\\'t let us on even though it\\'s at the gate. @United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate @united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent. @United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can\\'t find an empty gate? @united You\\'re trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant. @united we\\'ve been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing @United \"delayed due to customer service\" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1 @united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That\\'s it??? @united except all of that delayed the flight anyway. @United maybe find a different gate #ua1758 @united I sent a message. It\\'s very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous @United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt? @united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke @united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we\\'re hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations. @united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative. @united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn\\'t an option. @united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It\\'s now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484 @united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can\\'t use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge @united is so cheap they couldn\\'t afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline @united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he\\'s stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always @united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O\\'Hare in Chicago. @united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent @united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas? @united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain\\'t cool, yo. @united I didn\\'t have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn\\'t going to pay for another cab to do so. @united didn\\'t realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow. @united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent @united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I\\'d like to speak to someone about it. @united I\\'m really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been @united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this @united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there. @united so glad I\\'ve been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever. @united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep. @united lol too little too Late Flight @united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM @united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability @united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf @united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins. @united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief @united your seats are god awful. @united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner @united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed! @united I\\'m on UA1118 and my direct tv isn\\'t working.  How do I avoid this in future? @United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don\\'t believe gate agent that overhead is full; don\\'t reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK @united i sure will @united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn\\'t look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room? @united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s. @united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes. @united JP - DM message who? Can\\'t get a DM through to @united @united strikes again! Why board anyone if there\\'s something wrong with the plane? Common sense. @united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21. @united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD??? @united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence @united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn\\'t carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can\\'t watch the Oscars. #united @united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work. @united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay. @united I need help with a missing bag. @united I was. But I have given up. @united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help! @united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp... @united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers @united might possibly have the worst service on the planet. @united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited @united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR @united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I\\'m hoping its on there @united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse @united I honestly couldn\\'t tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse @united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better @united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind. @united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence @united why doesn\\'t my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow? @united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit @United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse! @united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy! @united I don\\'t know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I\\'m unable to do bc the site won\\'t let me.Seems to be ongoing @united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed! @united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I\\'ve been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies @united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston @united why do you hate your passengers? @united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn\\'t anyone actually do maintenance .@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good. @united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR @united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw. @united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool! @united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location @united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on @united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me. @united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines @united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!! @united false. @united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won\\'t let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all. .@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim @united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots. @united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines @united you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn\\'t even have curtesy to let me know,  #UnitedAirlines @united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays. @united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever @united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed). @united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me? @united been good 15yr \"friendly skies\" relationship. 2day agent told me I\\'m \"only Canadian\" and thus not good enough for military preboard @united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots “@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience* “@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn\\'t been great. .@united I think not. I\\'m not flying you again, if I can help it. @united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever @united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle. @united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071 .@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it? @united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst @united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD @united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don\\'t get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people. @united customer service what\\'s That??? @united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for \\'more quick fixes\\' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline @united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!! @united that\\'s what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!! @united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding @united now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr @united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don\\'t provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles @united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off @united seriously what\\'s with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn\\'t go up! . @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines @united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids! @united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead! @united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport @united every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card. @united so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage @united 8 hours Late Flightr and I\\'m siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service! @united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags @united now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ?? @United\\u200b has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status. @united yes I have &amp; they\\'re unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed @united of course. But interesting how United doesn\\'t seem to have a good sense on what\\'s happening with flight @united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately. @united you guys are complete ass @united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT. @united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids. @united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight @united have you read your own same day travel change policy? @united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k @united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a \"snow storm in Denver\". And now I\\'m in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+ @united still sucks. I don\\'t understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks @united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous \"I dunno what time you will leave today. \". Dunno?! That\\'s code for ...? @united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter @united I\\'d rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster @united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it\\'s departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!! @united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains! @united you could give me free flights for life, and I\\'d still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor. @united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled @united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why? @united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending @united is by far THE WORST airline I\\'ve ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I\\'ve flown to!!! It\\'s outrageous! @united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now? @united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime @united I hope you lose the next govt contract @united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux @united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you! @united the bag is in a state that I didn\\'t travel to and the airports don\\'t fly to each other. Looks like it\\'ll never show @united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not! @united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor @united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn\\'t here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing @united seriously. This is just complete bs. @united, we\\'ve been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives? @united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad! @united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks @united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake @united ouch not fair @united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don\\'t know how to value the customer @united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it\\'s unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling @united if I miss the #Oscars I\\'ll never fly united again @united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy @united flight delayed...again...every time. \"Maintenance issues\" @united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned @united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice @united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can\\'t get their tiny TVs to work! @united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn\\'t get an email. @united, maybe don\\'t play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn\\'t working...✈️ @united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information. @united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ @united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC @united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again @united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l @united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made @united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation @United - In case you\\'re reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules. @United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there\\'s no overhead space. @united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable. @united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K.... @United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I\\'m glad it\\'s free for now. @united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It\\'s been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame.. @united agent, \"You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full.\" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited @united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks. @united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren\\'t booked. Renting a car. @united I\\'ll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means. @united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update. @United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out? @united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge. @United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO. @united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me @United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time. @united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I\\'m in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer @united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport @united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren\\'t booked. Renting a car. @united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst @united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable @united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now????? @united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to \\'passenger comfort\\'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would ! @united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he\\'s booked me a flight @united you left my bag in Houston last night. It\\'s freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow. @united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn\\'t feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed @united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing. @united trying to check in for tomorrow\\'s flight. website keeps timing out. what\\'s up? @united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can\\'t rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc @United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The \"weather\" didn\\'t affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx @united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers\\' rights.  @AerocivilCol @united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight “@united:That\\'s not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved @united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex? @united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!! @united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I\\'m going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :( @united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn\\'t reseated. This only happens on international itineraries @united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don\\'t have time. @united \\n\\nThere must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations. @united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service. @united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a \\'missing screw\\' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed @united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff @united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good. @united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN @united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn\\'t want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎 @united you guys are gay @united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday @united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!! @united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k @united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time?? @united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate @united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this? @united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really? @United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun @united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡 @united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they\\'d transfer our bags to them. @united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better. @united I\\'m DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed @united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess @united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help! @United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService @united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that\\'s 7 hours you had. #fail! @united so many delays today...What\\'s up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K @united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks. @united called back and I\\'ve been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I\\'ve paid @united I\\'m not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps? @united check in and it\\'s still saying I haven\\'t paid. I\\'ve called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I @united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to @united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn\\'t paid for it. So I called was on @united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don\\'t care about our shoes. Ua649 @united @czamkoff It\\'s all about profit, and they don\\'t really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed @united I unfortunately didn\\'t get her name :( she was not nice! @united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously? @united My bag is lost and I can\\'t get ahold of anyone that can help @united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times! @united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I\\'m told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a \"no show\" @united never flying United again! Worst experience ever @united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that\\'s where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went. @united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep @united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable. @united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service @united direct messages not going through please help @united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn\\'t show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can\\'t be redeemed for upgrades thru your app @united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What\\'s worse is plane is here but crew can\\'t fly!! @united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a @united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium. @united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight! @united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai @united so what\\'s the solution? @united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted? @united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in. @united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper @united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do.. @united severely under staffed at Iah. @united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill @united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1 @united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs @united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues @united once again you guys didn\\'t let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming @united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax. “@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer @united not my luggage @united it\\'s boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe @united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 🆖 @united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don\\'t even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF @united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening? @united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system. @united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL @united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable @united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened? @united employee=faceless. Don\\'t throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I\\'m almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2 @united you can\\'t say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn\\'t even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi @united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand @united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService @united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate @united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting @united DM\\'d you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag. @united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain @united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn\\'t enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together @united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST! @united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance. @united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!! @united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled @united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws @united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr @United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately. @united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can\\'t guarantee them another flight for three days! @united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you\\'ve @united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN! .@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO @united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that \"really there are 3 not 4 seats\" @united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad @united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM. @united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy) @united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing? @united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn\\'t this done when the planes were sitting out all night? @united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight @united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K @united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don\\'t ask for extra peanuts... That\\'s NOT allowed! @AirCanada @united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed. @united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your \\'trained\\' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time @united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here @united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail @united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don\\'t you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn\\'t get changed mid-travel @united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue! @united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc @united they wouldn\\'t let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line.. @united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired @united, I don\\'t believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2 @united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks @united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever! @united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta @united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn\\'t the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim. @united why don\\'t you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/ @united fuck you for not caring 😢 @united its been five days, I\\'m just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don\\'t want to have to take this higher up. @united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST! @united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home! @united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll @united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable! @united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785 @united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears! @united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but... @United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you! @United why can\\'t you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue? @united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can\\'t contact! @united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can\\'t speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag! @united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines! @united I would never fly United Airlines again! @united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight. @united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days! @united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow @united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying \"think about your next flight...\" #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4 @united did your super computer 💩 ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers @united - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix! @united is your check-in system down? I\\'m having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs. @united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better. @united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY @united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to? @united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta @united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day @united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491 @united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta. @united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay.

I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded? @united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here @united your service need work - check out this Bush airport \"customer service line\" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv @united you realize you\\'ve said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed \"help\" @united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure. @united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp @united lost bag on next flight.

Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage. @united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited @united flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage??? @united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel @united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD @united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification? @united since I have an international connection at 9am, I\\'m hoping for the same thing! @united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room @united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money? @united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I\\'m delayed 10 hours now. What\\'s my refund options? @united where is my bag?? I\\'m in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M @united I know that. Thanks for the standard reply. @united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you @united This has been the WORST flight experience I\\'ve ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note. @united hey, it\\'s 4am, guess what I\\'m doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports @united no my concerns were not addressed @united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat @united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks @united oh, I\\'ll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA. @united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff? Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask? @united you hung up on me again. @united your \"customer service\" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can\\'t even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?! @united it\\'s disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I\\'ve received tonight. @united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That\\'s the ONLY reason I\\'ve been on hold for the past 5 hours! @united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration. @united you\\'ve got to be kidding me. I still haven\\'t talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow???? .@united I wouldn\\'t describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it. @united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best @united is that all that matters, not the fact that we\\'re at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress, @united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job @united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn\\'t there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!! @united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left. @united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I\\'ve gotten no help from you tonight. @united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I\\'ve had to call back 4x. That\\'s 240minute wait times. @united you\\'re customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I\\'ve been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x. @united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA @united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn\\'t let him fly is negligence. @united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why? @united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550 @united - you sure missed the mark on tonight\\'s redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better! @united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets @united where is our luggage @united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx @united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN! @united why don\\'t you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline... @united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me. @united That\\'s called throwing \"loyalty\" out the window and trying to give less awards. @united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I\\'m in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives?? @united I\\'d hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk? @united that\\'s not an apology. Say it. @united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest? @united no apology? Cool. @united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right? @united I\\'m a first time solo female traveller and it\\'s pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are... @united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers.... @united somehow I knew that you\\'d wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain. @united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100\\'s of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime @united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I\\'m trying to figure out how to get home. Cool. @united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time. @united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage @united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how \"wifi is coming!\" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw @united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD @united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn\\'t fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7 @united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!? @united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed @united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr @united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo @United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable. @united Freakin\" @united Suck @united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD @united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane @united I\\'m still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back. @united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #. @united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985 @united YOU SUCK! @united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age... @united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two @united just DM\\'d @united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :( @united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min @united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent. @united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this? @united I\\'m extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder. @united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks @united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou @united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience @united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv @united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm @united considering I\\'m now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available @united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though! @united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm? @United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk @United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney @united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare? @united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It\\'s been one mess up after another. Bad day @united @united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies @united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food. @united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards @united I\\'m rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat @united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter @united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don\\'t have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan @united we\\'ve been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We\\'ve only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed @united please get me off this plane #UA57 @united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable. @united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!? @united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed @united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification. @united Wife and I have two new destinations and I\\'m stuck in DC until Monday with no bags @united no I don\\'t. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw @united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it. @united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business @united when I read it say \\' in some cases\\' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case? @united I\\'m trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn\\'t a hard stream. @united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff @united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight @united why don\\'t you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for @united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don\\'t speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much @united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed. @united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying @united it\\'s 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would \"sit awhile\" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm. @united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I\\'ll never have to fly @united ever again .. @united I\\'d really like to get off of this plane now. @united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics @united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding. @united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn\\'t care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs @united My contact stuff is in the bag and I\\'m legally blind. This is so messed up. @united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I\\'m not going to have for how many days. @united 3 times I\\'ve called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can\\'t you call me back! @united Tell me that you\\'re at least going to cover a room and get me out of here. @united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse. @united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever. @united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to \"Try again Late Flightr\". @united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks @united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa @United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?! @united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick .@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you\\'ve got your work cut out for you. It\\'s bc you treat customers like garbage. @united Pay for my hotel.... I\\'m a broke student #help @united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help @united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter @united you\\'re terrible. @united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won\\'t be for days! @united Anyone there? Did you read my DM? @united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I\\'ve EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out @united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim. @united it\\'s been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc @united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can\\'t fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!! @united nope I gave up - maybe they\\'ll deliver it @united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications! @united and waiting @united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts. @united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight. @united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I\\'m still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution @united is the worst @united still waiting @united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not @united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH @united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue @united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful. @united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays. @united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight. @united unfortunately, they didn\\'t. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would @united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they\\'re handling my connecting flight. @united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks @united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I\\'m Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta @united And yet we still haven\\'t left yet and I can\\'t watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems @united yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question. .@united Let us know when you find everyone\\'s luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines @united Nope! I\\'m on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice. @united Still do not have my bag, it\\'s in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm. @united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies @united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help? @united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest @united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs. @united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area @united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed! @united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I\\'m waiting at customer service. @united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it! @united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks @united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can\\'t leave. @united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight! @united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff? Reply to @united - Doesn\\'t do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction. @united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I\\'m 1K. @united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I\\'d have to pay. @united never again. @united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren\\'t our fault. @united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest @united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint. @united God damn fucking crew won\\'t be here till 6:40, so you\\'ve known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit. @united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they\\'re short staffed @united sucks. @united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix? @united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents. @united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK @united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed @united We\\'ve let you know how to help the millions of customers you\\'ve treated like garbage. It\\'s no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline. @united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent. @united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious. @united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212 @united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call. @united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline @united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!! @united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous! @united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx @united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!! @united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it\\'s beyond repair. I\\'m beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations. @united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed? @united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x. @united you have a culture issue @united rep wouldn\\'t rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication @united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days! @united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service. @united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes?? @united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help! @united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I\\'m back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost @united i\\'m glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United @united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2 @United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out? @united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this? @united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip. @united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don\\'t have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke @united meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if u wanted I would have booked it - u will get formal complaint @united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I\\'ve even though I have platinum and the other person none @united haven’t before and haven’t this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing @united sloppy stuff you don\\'t see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor @united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email? @united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags @united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers @united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane @united no wheelchairs @united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance @united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f @united this team added 30 mins on turnaround @united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer @united yes, I\\'ve been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me. @united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!! @united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt @united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection @united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct? @united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW @united please don\\'t take my membership away :( @united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning. @united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn\\'t understand the concept of time zones, thanks! @united but your system gave my seat away.now I\\'m 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away? @united yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request” @united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L @united any help is appreciated. That\\'s a LOOONG wait for help on something that\\'s not his fault @united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there\\'s a 1hr wait on phone @united is probably the least satisfactory airline I\\'ve ever been on. Never fails to disappoint. @united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don\\'t care @united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now. @united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn\\'t happen to me with them.  I\\'ll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you. @united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don\\'t sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail @united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It\\'s kind of like being robbed.Explain @united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don\\'t know how you manage to do it. @united the worst customer service in Denver. @united ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ @united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse @united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals @united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice @united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, \"not with my hands!\" #badservice @united I need #United to be a better airline!! @united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can\\'t help me @united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You\\'re welcome. #badservice @united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross! @united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint. @united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes @united that\\'s a crazy long form! You need something other than a video? @united I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow @united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous @united You shouldn\\'t page o\\'head that it\\'s best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins @united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I\\'ll try #Delta @united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list. @united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around. @united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait. @united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first @united can\\'t get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can\\'t be looked in the eyes by anyone. @united nope.

Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days @united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt @United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have? @united is not a company that values it\\'s customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I\\'m not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness @united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip @united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help? @united well if you don\\'t want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity @united employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) @dad_or_alive @united But it\\'s doubtful he\\'ll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America @united Worst customer non-service for sure! @united Worst airline ever? @united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks @united need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids. @united Friend at O\\'Hare and can\\'t get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass. @United Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks http://t.co/kKEDjNRTWo” @united Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there\\'s no difference. @united can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it\\'s previous destination? Flight 3618 @united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened @united I would like 2 speak @United VP of #CustExp Jimmy Samartzis! I sent a survey/email about my awful flight exp http://t.co/OtFZ7CygUQ @united we are delayed in San Pedro, Belize. We are scheduled to fly out at 3pm from Belize City to Houston. Will you wait please? @united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me. @united Great!  I\\'m guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you\\'re overcharging, and don\\'t care that everyone is miserable. @united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE. @united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/oKtUkjY92O (via @ParachuteGuy) @united I\\'m on snowy roads to BWI.

Pls help @united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me @united remember in business, a pleasant experience, means you will tell a friend. A bad experience means you will tell everyone you see @united let me assure you my travel time is 4h2m not 5h2m #timezones #accuratetraveltimes #3rdtimethishashappened http://t.co/e0C9bI09cf @united U BUMS HOW DO U LOSE THE BIGGEST BAG ON THE FLIGHT @united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet @united customers ✅. Customer service ❌ http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP @united great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don\\'t, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!! Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. @united: The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole.. @united in the process of purchasing ticket, when prices changed. unbelievable. #RipOffs #PriceDiscrimination @united although, I am stranded in Chicago O\\'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal? @united 14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy @united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines @united really fucked my day up Hilo to LAX 2hr30min delay because of software? missed connection, getting home 8hrs Late Flightr no upgrade nothin @united send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a. @united I\\'m not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw @united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we\\'re not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml @united it\\'s my 21st birthday and my sister is coming to celebrate but her flights keep Cancelled Flighting PLZ do all you can to get her here!!!! @united what\\'s the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN?? @united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That\\'s wrong @united Yeah that didn\\'t happen! @united Why do I still not have my bags? They arrived @10AM &amp;website says they\\'re still at the airport..2 1/2 hours Late Flightr???!! #nothappy @United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won\\'t even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really. @united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I\\'ve selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade! @united no announcement re extra baggage, \"find an empty bin\" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing @united bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly @ContinentalAir1 Here\\'s hoping @united wakes up @united Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don\\'t honor it?? .@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names. @united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff! @united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane @united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA @united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites @United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog @united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins @united I\\'m strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines @united your website won\\'t allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties** @united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the \"inflight wifi\" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines @united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices? @united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first @united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation\\'s not happening? Website wasn\\'t working. @united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523 @united what\\'s going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days. @united what incentive do I have to give you another chance? @united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15. @united @baldordash Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr.  Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment! @united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent @United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can\\'t even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United! @united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A\\'dam. Let\\'s see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states. @united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines @united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should\\'ve listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE @united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks. @united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane! @united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn\\'t left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left. @united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response. @united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines @united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I\\'m needing some help reFlight Booking Problems. @united I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number @united I\\'m afraid not... I fly or service every week and I\\'m just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy @united if you\\'re going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don\\'t stall the inevitable. @united your plane\\'s been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck. @united \\nFlight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience @united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better. @united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst! @united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6 @united your \"Airserv\" contractors aren\\'t worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity. @united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement @united web app won\\'t let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it\\'s a pita @united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I\\'m afraid @united while busy on his cell phone ??? @united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address. @united: \"Left gate 5 minutes early.\" \\nMy thoughts: \"That doesn\\'t count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour.\" #comeonpeople @united on flight 1665 but it\\'s not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean? @united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn\\'t have to check @united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it @united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3) @united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best @united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM @United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual @united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh. @united never fails to have delayed flights 😡 @united Yes, myself and about 200 other people also. @united it\\'s been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I\\'m counting on it! #TeamUSA @united is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks @united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees @united I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX @ 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight @united  No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi. @united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever @united\\'s first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks. @united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane \"loses its software\" I believe you decided to do an upgrade... @united already missed connection... UA 495 @united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight... @united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say \"oh well\" @united Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service. @united no. U guys suck. I\\'ll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too. @united on a flight to New York! Love the quality planes on United!! #WTF #crappy #aviation #NewYork http://t.co/zv6CfPoHl5 @united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer. @united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on @united @danahajek : United\\'s CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff @united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed? @united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can\\'t respond b/c she\\'s alone @united I was flying home for a 9:30am event tomorrow. You pushed back my flight. Now I have a $400 ticket that won\\'t get me home in time. @united - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!! @united flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out. @united - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here\\'s hoping they arrive @united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I\\'m worn out! #EnoughIsEnough @united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service. @united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service? @united She 👏 won\\'t 👏 be 👏 at 👏 my 👏 wedding 👏. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There\\'s no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this? @united Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He\\'s competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help @united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy @United Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help. @united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer? @united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with \"issues\"... @united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope. @united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on? @united no still trying to get home. @united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats @united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats @united very exasperating I\\'m having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you\\'re undergoing maintenance. Really, now? @united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow @united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane @united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return. @united no u don\\'t @united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission! @united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off. @united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service @united Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs &amp; i missed my connectin flight. PJ\\'s I TELL U! #NYFW @united if I wait I\\'ll lose the flight. So frustrating. @united it most certainly was not. @united trying to book flight w/miles. Was on hold for 50m before I gave up. Need to get 6 on same flight using two diff # and pay 4 1tix @united THAT\\'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you\\'re not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain @united y not? You\\'re the reason we\\'re in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry. @united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary @united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight! @united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I\\'d be mortified if my employees acted as yours @United has time to respond to everyone else\\'s complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer @united \"most likely\" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks. @united tell me something I don\\'t know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea @united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that\\'s crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally “@united: @leigh_emery We don\\'t like to hear this. Is there anything we can help with? Thanks. ^EY” another empty offer for help. @united I\\'m try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help? @united UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior. @united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best. @united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh @united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost @united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at? @united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together! @united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face! @united I hope so but I\\'ve received no help so far. I\\'ve been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me? @united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice @united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD. @united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja @united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded @united I miss the Continental days. @united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares. @united It wasn\\'t full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?! @united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?! @united Thanks for nothing. Next time I\\'ll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right? @united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough @united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac @united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven\\'t pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information. @united have better customer service at John Wayne airport. @united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn\\'t at the bar. @united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What\\'s up with that??? @united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I\\'m stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in. @united you\\'re right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok. @united - we\\'re sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can\\'t find captain. #ridiculous #united @united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced... @united Stuck in Houston because you can\\'t seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions. @united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines. @united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5 @united I\\'m Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don\\'t care about your customers. Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you \"can\\'t do anything\" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7 @united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw @united you guys suck! @united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot. @united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting.. @united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember @united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I\\'m furious right now. @united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M @united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great. @united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn\\'t fix it. Flight was listed on website, but \"unavailable\"to book. False advertising much? @united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes \"like every 15 minutes.\" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we\\'re taking a cab. You going to reimburse? @united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it? @united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none. @united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks @united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience. @united How can I file a claim when your agents won\\'t let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON\\'T find my bag @united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean? @united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don\\'t fly united @united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this. @united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change. @united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end? @United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157 @united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go @united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks @united Your \"Loyalty Team\" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google \"loyalty\" and get back to me? ^LOL Hey @united, this is your job, don\\'t give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks @united, if you mean beyond opaque \"maintenance issues\", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can\\'t manage. @united \"Dear Ted. We don\\'t care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United\" . @united sad that you don\\'t think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful @united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1) @united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day! @united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way. @united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can\\'t even make this stuff up. @united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it\\'s in Bosnia.  Here\\'s another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs @united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible. @united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors. @united now I\\'ll probably miss my next connection! @united you may think I\\'m joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight. @united not the case. Now delayed due to \"mechanical issues with no update on departure time\". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta @united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!! @united I didn\\'t get a message from you. I\\'ll resend numbers. @United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don\\'t mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume. @united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won\\'t be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA. @united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA @united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL @united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business! @united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don\\'t have my bag!!! @united Why haven\\'t you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!! @united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF @united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE @united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you\\'d like me to continue flying your airline. @united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that\\'s another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies @united already Flight Booking Problems next week\\'s trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail @united Also, group 5 is total BS. @united Don\\'t ask me to be patient without offering something in return. @united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100 @united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable @united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd. @united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can\\'t change. @united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I\\'ve been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO @united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn\\'t cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi! @united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock @united worst AIRLINE \\nBEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN \\nBEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/ @united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore. @united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight. @united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight @united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs @united also doesn\\'t help me. I\\'m a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing. @united delayed another hour @united Can\\'t beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already... @United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail @united don\\'t need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable. @united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back. @united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon! @United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997! @united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo @united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it\\'s at the airport you couldn\\'t get me too... @united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can\\'t deliver it in a timely manner. @united I\\'m sorry it\\'s cold in chicago, but I don\\'t see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel. @united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool. @united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight @united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it\\'s changed to refreshments. Where\\'s my refund? @united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we\\'ll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated @united we can\\'t all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji @united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let\\'s make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks @United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right. .@united It\\'s worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. \"But there are rules\" says @united @united I\\'m fully aware, it\\'s just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you\\'re going to resell my seat for more $. @united why I won\\'t check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH @united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always. @united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website @united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated. @united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution. @united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all. @united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark @united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport @united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn\\'t cleaned properly. @United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you. @united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn\\'t cleaned properly @united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO @united I can\\'t even look at you right now. I\\'ll call you when I\\'m not so mad. @united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach @united Nope, still sitting at the gate! @united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey @united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations .@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven\\'t taken off for a 10:30 am flight @united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed @united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky @united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane. @united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25! @united That\\'s still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day. @united MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure. @united your customer service is crap. @united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks! @united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate. @united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable. @united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn\\'t. @united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9 @united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness? @united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes @united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE @united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline. @united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that \"slight delay\" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation. @united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can\\'t reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number. @united worst flight experience I\\'ve ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again. @united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line? @united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie @united hey! DM not working. UA 307! @united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it\\'s like sir u r lying how can I help @united splitting up my flights quadruples the price @united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used? @united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder @united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn\\'t caused by weather @united what I don\\'t understand isn\\'t flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight... @united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can\\'t use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous @united actually we aren\\'t. Still parked here. @united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights? @united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page, @united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you\\'ve lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx! @united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years. @united I\\'m familiar with the procedure. It wouldn\\'t be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler @united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn\\'t seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact @united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour? @united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF? @united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes @united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days @united your website is a complete joke when using safari! @united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck. @united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman @united that\\'s the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒 @united Did somebody say flight upgrade? @united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious @united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. \\nThis day and age message through Twitter travels fast. @united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye! @united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service. @united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can\\'t wait to give up my gold status for AA. @united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service @united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff @united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous. @united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance? @united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help @united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx @united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time. @united I\\'m not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I\\'m extra bloated. @united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous. @united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays. @united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change? @united I\\'m rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I\\'ll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler @united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $? @united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the \"broken lightbulb\" @united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don\\'t understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary. @united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other @united Without baggage for 5 days and can\\'t get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever! @united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill @united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though. @united or I\\'m sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo @united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation! @united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver @united we are on two more flights today, let\\'s hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH @united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight? @united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue @united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them @united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we\\'re going to miss @united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that\\'s fixed but can\\'t board because flight crew didn\\'t stay in boarding area #fail @united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket. @united yes, but they still don\\'t know where it is.  I\\'ve been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it. @United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I\\'ll burn it for warmth. #united @united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board. @united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours @united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management @united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited @united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that \"sandwich.\" @united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket? @united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k @united your customer service is terrible @united please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O @united define \"appreciate\". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback. @united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip. @united that\\'s wonderful. unfortunately doesn\\'t help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed @united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation @united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled? @united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything. @united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail .@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours. @united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service @united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I\\'d rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit. @united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers @united couldn\\'t have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed @united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That\\'s all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail @united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I\\'m not missing one. It was added to my bag .... @united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow @united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd @united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don\\'t lie on screensand say it\\'s weather @united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting. @united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn\\'t pay for the extra leg room @united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not. @united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest. @united Stuck in. ORD because United can\\'t find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now. @united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not! @united 2nd time in a row  I\\'ve been over charged by 100\\'s of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn\\'t have to check my CC everytime @united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded. .@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it\\'s not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG. @united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline @united I\\'m sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don\\'t cut it @united or you\\'ll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did @united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through. @united what\\'s the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it? @united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning \"due to operation\" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today! @united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus. @united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA @united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated @united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers @united I need assistance with pulling your agents\\' heads out of their asses @united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an \"UNMET ARRIVAL\"!! @united @abigailedge Another glitch?? @united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks @United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac \"waiting for papers\"... Cannot miss my connection at IAH ! @united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse. @united no chance in hell. I\\'d rather walk. Worst airline ever. @United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they\\'re boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf? @united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49 @united don\\'t know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love. @united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives. @united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU @united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate. @united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal! @united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare @united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection? @united I\\'m counting on you, please don\\'t let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce @United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination? @united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation @united  oh united, how much I despise thee! @united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world. @united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome @united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first @united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!! @united Why don\\'t you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I\\'m still wating for my tickets!! I\\'m getting really angry and disappointed! @united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again. @united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer. Thanks @united, great news that u won\\'t refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals @united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta @united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep @united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos @united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they? @united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient @united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument. @united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money @united accordingly? U dont respond at all @united \"the extra care airline\". #unitedairlines they don\\'t care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don\\'t have 1 @united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :( @united it\\'s a shame the great customer service wasn\\'t continued in SFO. Slightly absurd @united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys. @united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines @united has happened on other airlines and they\\'ve given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems. @united thanks, I\\'m booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis. @united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? @united: @JenniferWalshPR Your dissatisfaction is und There were plenty of empty seats in coach \"@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f\" @united all good, didn\\'t die or anything. As they say \"you get what you pay for\"! @united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou @united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable @united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United! @united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don\\'t like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We\\'ll have you on your way ASAP @united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can\\'t UAL be honest with its customers? @united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven\\'t left the airport yet. @united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn\\'t have problems would be wonderful @United agent did help me. My point: there\\'s a problem &amp; I don\\'t want it to mess up somebody else\\'s plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls? .@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I\\'m also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again @united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system. @united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren\\'t alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect @united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united @united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help! @united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response @united  they were empty upon takeoff. Why can\\'t someone sit there? @united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it\\'s 2/19... 7-10 days I\\'ll get a response, BS! @united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I\\'m not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though... @united €202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots? @united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement. @united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2 @united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm @united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ? @united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I\\'ll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course @united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled @united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family @united it wasn\\'t a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn\\'t an issue either. @united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day @united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven\\'t really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable @united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta @united Yes my flight was rebooked. I\\'m just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time. @united any solutions? @united I\\'m over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup @united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don\\'t have that ID- you should find it @united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn\\'t care either. It is expected @United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE @united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful @united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week\\'s average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm @united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus @united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there. @united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞 .@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now. @united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer? @united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again. @united it\\'s freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR @united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn\\'t the crew here#tiredcustomer @united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress? @united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right? @united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match. @united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡 @united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6 @united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline? @united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm @united thanks KP.  What\\'s going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can\\'t u give customers good info. Not waste their time?! @united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site! @united 4840 WTF! Why can\\'t you update your times in a timely manner? You\\'ve known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN @united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That\\'s the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h @united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ? @united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time. @united I\\'m in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here. @united you know it\\'s bad when you\\'re praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome @united playing hide and seek with the gate. \"We can\\'t find it, it should only be a few more minutes.\" @united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed. @united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can\\'t figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X @united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i @united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff @united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land! @united I\\'d rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF @united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!?? @united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation. @united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O\\'hare... Painful @united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it\\'s still in Albany and they won\\'t have a plane.  Someone is compensating me @united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one? @united WHAT?! Y\\'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too! .@united just curious why you\\'d board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no? @united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL @united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays @united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate? @united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays? @united be worse?oh you can\\'t! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning. @united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account! @united should contact me and the others on my flight who can\\'t get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk @united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience. @united silence is very telling @united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn\\'t break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2 @united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5 @united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM @united I\\'m confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK @united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection “@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KP”. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5. @united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet. @united one hour after departure time and still no update! @united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger @united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe? @united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever! @united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother @united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent @united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more @united How is this considered \"on time\" if it\\'s arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr @united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont… @united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now. @united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can\\'t seem to know why the plane hasn\\'t left Albany. #Fail @united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted @united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail @united an update on flight 5979 would be great! @united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated @united what is the problem with your flights to ny today @united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins) @united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir @united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail @united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines! @united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.\\nFrustrating! @united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it\\'s about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place @united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working @united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I\\'ll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute. @united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved @united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ?? @united would be hard to be worse than last time but I\\'m sure you\\'ll give it a shot @united service staff to is less than friendly! @united Can you transfer my bags too? @united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight. @united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done. @united you had us REBOARD without the captain.  So now we\\'ll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? http://t.co/EEReKDf9Fq @united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I\\'m Late Flight now? @united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce @united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP! @united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient. @united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More..... @united smiling? NOT!! @united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!! @united @bwood we\\'d prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline @united why do you bother surveying me! @united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I\\'m taking my premier status to A @united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it @united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line @united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service @united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada? @united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I\\'ll be switching back to delta. @united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call @united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK @united installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn\\'t let me back in. Four wasted hours. @united that\\'s what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!! @united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They\\'ve apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call. @united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can\\'t tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is? @united seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great. @united \"We like hearing from you.\" So why haven\\'t you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi @united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something. @united 1k use to be special.  80 people in group one.   Why not board global AND 1k together? http://t.co/qd2lyUXAZg @united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife\\'s 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks @united As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers. @united I\\'m not as sure as you are. http://t.co/HSMpbSF4UF @united how does that help me with my customers that I couldn\\'t meet with (and subsequently lost)? @united problem is on laptop not phone @united question - was given food vouchers but can\\'t use on plane..how   come @united the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up @united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame. @united too long for 140 characters @united Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = 😔 @united tried that already &amp; tried forgetting the wifi network connection. Still forces log in with incorrect email. Other suggestions? @united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi @united or did you mean 24-26? @united has it been 4-6hrs yet? @united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting! @United does a great job of answering public messages. Direct private messages, not so much. @united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won\\'t waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms. @united how\\'s my refund coming along?? @united ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!? @united 777 from SFO to HNL with ZERO entertainment systems???!!!#youareonyourown @united how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don\\'t see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!! @united flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together. @united Just saying the truth. You don\\'t even an email! #2015 @united MR, she\\'s on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please http://t.co/V8PVpHMtZc @united we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way @united I sent you a dm hours ago @united Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247. @united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag @united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn\\'t make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks @united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up! @united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I\\'m not sure I understand your tweet. @united I\\'m a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I\\'m frustrated @united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime @united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers! @united Case ID 8544484 @united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don\\'t recline. @united to DM you I have to follow you and I\\'m not doing that. Plus they\\'re no more options. That\\'s why I had to fly with you. #epicfail @united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry @united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am @united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes. @united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday\\'s flight from Houston to Sao Paulo @united Contacted yesterday and was told that there\\'s nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service??? @united unfortunately, that doesn\\'t help. Just an automated computer. @united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is. @united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back... @united I must stop my relationship with you. You\\'ve become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over @united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks @united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline. @united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd... @united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It\\'s STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!! @united I guess that\\'s not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers. @united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay. @united need to chat with an actual human ASAP! @united I got an email saying \"changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed\" but I didn\\'t make any changes. Help? @united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good @united what a joke. Hang up on customers!! @united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren\\'t charged Just hung up on me!! @united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail @united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus @united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it\\'s not here yet. @united can you help from there? UA4935 can\\'t take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour. @united That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal. @united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she\\'s on 2 days of travel now and we\\'ve had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that @united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/ @united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened @united I\\'m not booked on a 1:30 return flight.. @united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly @united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives? @united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen. @united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don\\'t understand why there wasn\\'t a better estimate 3 hrs ago @united \"where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline\" #wellplayed #jokesonus @united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place? @united I\\'ll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option @united I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received? @united that\\'s what I have been told. But refund doesn\\'t really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it? @united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight? @united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight.... @united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn\\'t wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead @united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless @united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious @united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!! @united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir @united sure... You\\'ve been saying that for as long as I\\'ve been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free. @united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense? @united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck @united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don\\'t check their planes properly. @united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH .@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now. @united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA. @united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed @united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on @united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life. @united booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err \"no segment in this\" @united no- we are boarding- but why can\\'t your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!! @united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated. @united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful. @united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez. @united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn\\'t have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in? @united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it @united thx. Come hell or high water... @united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting @united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn\\'t do the same. #stillwaiting. @united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho. @united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now? @united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me. @united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again... @united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr... @united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today... @united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am! @united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I\\'ll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica... @united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife @united ^GJ flight 1101 didn\\'t have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment @united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here. @united : Unhappy with United\\'s service?\\n\\nRead Ralph Nader\\'s open letter to UAL\\'s CEO.\\n\\nLeave a comment or RT.\\n\\nhttp://t.co/O0745APIau @united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice @united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees. @united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d @united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2) @united error message said couldn\\'t process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2) @united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting... @united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment @united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag... @united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don\\'t work you cheap as);: @united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free. @united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that\\'s he\\'s going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He\\'s a hoot! @united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I\\'ve EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines @united I can\\'t tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg. @united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround @united @staralliance the B gates are very far though @united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels @united I would have made it if you hadn\\'t already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation. @united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out. @united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help? @united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take? @united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!! @united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air! @united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give? @united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi @united it\\'s not there we tried. It\\'s already here in cancun just no one has delivered it @united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your \"customer feedback\" @united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru @united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable @united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline @united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service? @united oh no, I\\'m rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation. @united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!! @united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM @united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace @united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We\\'ll wait. @United I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way... @united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary @united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You\\'ve Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me. @united &amp; I\\'ve been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now @united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives???? @united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!! @united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now @united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight. @united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL! @united you can\\'t claim \"weather\" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won\\'t @united you\\'re missin the point! There was no \"weather\". You\\'re lying! Seats was broken. But u claim \"weather\" to get out of hotels. Classy @united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year? @united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain @united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn\\'t turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time @united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number @united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me @united yes I have @united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated @united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech @united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail @united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering. @united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks. @united I\\'m asking if you can simplify the communications- thx @United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It\\'s getting real old real quick!! @united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been.. @united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight. @united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible. @united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating @united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security? @united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn\\'t look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that\\'s not guaranteed @united plz don\\'t advertise wifi if it\\'s not gonna work thanks #worstflightever @united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times. @united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn\\'t add up. @united hello. I\\'m overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can\\'t call customer service but can you help me? @united I knew I should\\'ve flew @VirginAmerica lol @united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with? @united My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences. @united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked! @united It was quite enjoyable. 😊 \\n\\nExcept now he\\'s stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕 @united makes total sense, except flight wasn\\'t full :) I\\'ve got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded. @united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O\\'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight. @united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ @united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail @united, I\\'m still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD @united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection. @united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am @united I\\'m flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let\\'s see if they are any better.... @united it\\'s almost like we\\'re punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good @united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int\\'l flights, it\\'s crazy @united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag... @united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help @united correct date is 2/11/15! @united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you? @united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required @united can\\'t DM, you\\'re not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats. @united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us @united 1 hour since boarding began and we\\'re still sitting at the gate.  #UA507 @united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle @united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs @united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11 @united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to \"fix\" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane @united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can\\'t be determined better. @united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline @united idea: if u don\\'t want us to be frustrated don\\'t Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber @united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight @united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn\\'t arrive until 6:07 @united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport @united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business @united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine @united thanks I\\'ll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to. @united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on @united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to.... @united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay? “@united: @qlyss8 We don\\'t want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one. @united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please! @united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad... @united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better? @united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact? I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united @united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying @united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed. @united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr! @united just informed you don\\'t reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you @united Midland couldn\\'t get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there. @united this may be the last time I fly your airline. @united Is your company motto: \"I do not care!!!\"  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.\"  #idonotcare @united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing. @united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we\\'re off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466 @united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened \"do you want to get to SF today\" #fail @united flying lax to Sfo and system won\\'t let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you. @united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn\\'t take away a 9year old kids bag! @united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I\\'m not a grown man but tears happened @united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back! @united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay. @united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!? @united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse? @united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse? @united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards @united Can someone assist me with my DM\\'s? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter. @united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer. @united As a Million Miler I\\'ve been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I\\'d be embarrassed to be affiliated. @united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won\\'t honor a lower fare that I found. @united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I\\'m mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad @united still can\\'t dm, it\\'s LH7631 on 21/2/15 @united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn\\'t the least bit frustrating. #customerservice @united, Thanks, but I didn\\'t want to see \\'we\\'ve started your flight search over\\' OR \\'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed\\' again @united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won\\'t be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭 @united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight. @united now you\\'ve lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd. @united What\\'s up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail @united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight! @united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees @united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M). @united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do? @united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience @united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn\\'t let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight! @united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn\\'t work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :( @united Nice \"partners\" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R @united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies @united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help. @united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you @United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You\\'ve been doing this for 2 hrs. @united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating! @united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee. @united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact? @united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too. @united 2nd Late Flight flight today @united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $\\'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles? @united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ @united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip). @united your overall experience of flying is not friendly @united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn\\'t delayed due to frozen water lines. @united annnnddddd I\\'m going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to @united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me @united every time I check a bag with your airline I\\'m confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong. @united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver @united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k @united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is. @united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United \"coworkers\" I\\'m guessing our benefits aren\\'t great. @united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I\\'m speechless at your system @united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn\\'t mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap. @united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I\\'m actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense. @united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet @United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible \"policies\".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now. @united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems @united (2/2) It suggests that if can\\'t confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn\\'t used to be that way 2/2 @united You don\\'t really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That\\'s fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies 1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money. @united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool @united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies @united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right? @United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it\\'s time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA @united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it\\'s now impossible! I even called. @united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn\\'t left and were pulling into the gate @united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn @united a plane took our gate and now we\\'re just waiting in a lot at DIA @united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP @united - with airport self checkin your only option I\\'m now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap. @united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting. @united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell @united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?! @united of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else . @united 65 and 72 year old flying to Tokyo for vacation both with bad knees and this happens https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu @cbcallinaday @CBCNews @united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now @united there\\'s no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond. @united yes, I know that. The question is \"why is that still the case\"? #fail @united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX @united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA\\'s actions? Terrible. # united @united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis @united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don\\'t pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines @united JH: going to process my refund for wifi. its asking for a receipt #? I never received an email- you guys just whacked my credit card .@united Don\\'t post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris .@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don\\'t cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies @united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned \"confirmed\" certificates? @united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn\\'t make an announcement @united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we\\'ve had? Our reservation is MKWLKR. @united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I\\'m very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that. @united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great! @united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don\\'t have a good feeling about your airline. @united we have been told that it\\'s lost...you guys don\\'t know where it is .@united: Just landed. A day Late Flight with almost no sleep, but here. I feel sorry for the woman I consoled who\\'s mother died during the night. @united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for @united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer. @united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was \"frozen\"! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver @united  delayed about 8 hours because of missed connections due to mechanical issues on 1st flight. rebooked, but please call me 9148445695 . @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don\\'t know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags @united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening @united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!! @united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next? @united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT. @united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United? @united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether @united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn\\'t forced to use United on certain routes, I never would. @united I\\'m checked in, agent wouldn\\'t tag my bags at 7am. Now I\\'m standing in line hell. @united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate. @united this is getting ridiculous. Now we\\'re missing our connection. @united Couldn\\'t use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them? @united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight. @united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We\\'re at 20 minutes per person. @united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size @united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy. @united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don\\'t lose em! @united Monday evening. @United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful. @united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now @united if you\\'re listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times! @united that\\'s funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn\\'t left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!! @united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don\\'t even know where it is! @united why haven\\'t you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating @United what the...? I go into the \"all airlines lounge\" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn\\'t accepted @united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines @united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service.

Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days @united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don\\'t need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones @united @laurasbrown5 What does \"dealing via email\" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices @united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer @united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations @united @gg8929 I\\'m sorry United isn\\'t able to keep its word \\'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it\\'s a customer fault! @united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever. @united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines @united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail? @united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens.... @united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag? @united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN @united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can\\'t tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits... @united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times. @united how come I have no baggage updates. @united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren\\'t honored at all. Disappointing @United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy @united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr? @united 3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site &amp; can\\'t book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn\\'t really available. #lies #falseadvertising @united next flight? Don\\'t think I\\'ll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad. @united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here. @united why couldn\\'t you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding? @united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail @united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday @united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I\\'m cranky and want an update. @united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology @united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible. @united unless it\\'s on you guys, im good. @united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol @united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way. @united Where are my bags!!!  They weren\\'t in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you. @united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514 @united still haven\\'t received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information. @united I\\'ve been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They\\'re only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!! @united RTB&gt;IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls @united \"federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag\"...yet you lose our bag and that\\'s okay @united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees... @united do you guys have any working planes? @united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!! @united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it. @united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won\\'t move. This biz traveler is never flying u again! @united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped. @united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2) @united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there. @united Direct Messaged you, didn\\'t hear anything back @united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months @united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn\\'t you put me onto them in the first place? @united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou @united my golf bag didn\\'t have a top cover + staffers said they couldn\\'t check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag... @united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow? @united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something @united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR... @united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn\\'t an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven\\'t waited less than 20min in years @united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we\\'ve been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads @united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I\\'m open to what will u do to make the \"flight more pleasant.\" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW @united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day. @united it\\'s Late Flight... I\\'m tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn\\'t chipper, but I def was not rude. @united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum @united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag! @united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that. @united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result. @united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public. @united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know @united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u. @united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund? @united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it? @united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…? @united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again. @united free hotel doesn\\'t make up for such poor customer service and disregard @united it\\'s messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting. @united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD @united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail @united how else would I know it was denied? @united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who\\'s left holding the bag.\\n#flyunited @united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice @united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive @united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets. @united I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way? @united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land @united I\\'ve been doing this for 15 years and I\\'ve never had this many issues with any other airline. @united haha that\\'s fine. Still won\\'t fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else. @united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal @united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY @united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf @united I\\'m on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that\\'s in UnitedFirst. @united you already have vomit so you are halfway there @united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !! @united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff @united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people. @united you guys suck. You delay flights but can\\'t hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver @united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United @united it was an international flight, and we didn\\'t get our new eta until we were in the air. @united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta ! @united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out. @united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse? @united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!! @united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this. @united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse... @united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain @united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5 @united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55. @united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable @united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there. @united @annricord 0162431184663.\\n3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket. @united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff @united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty @United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5 @united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me @united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting.... @united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup @united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken. @united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I\\'m gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours... @united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful. @united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67 @united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun @united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again! @united can you not see the thread? @united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :) @united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport @united also why can\\'t I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I\\'m a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv. Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I\\'m sorry, we\\'re not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP @united I shouldn\\'t have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL @united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it. @united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago? @united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund. @united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt. @united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected. @united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!! @united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united. @united I\\'m 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn\\'t bad!👎👎 @united @el_ingeniero don\\'t check your baggage if you don\\'t have to.  They will lose it! @United I\\'m hoping we don\\'t miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN! @united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus @united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?! @united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection? @united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ @united Call customer service and of course they just say \"theres nothing we can do\" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line. @united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks @united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for? @united Classic @united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input? @united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering. @united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can\\'t believe you guys actually charge people to \"fly\" united @united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead. @united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available @united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn\\'t like the exchange rate? #doublestandards @united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn\\'t receive, how do I know this won\\'t happen this time? @united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail @united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united @united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone. @united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke. @united They couldn\\'t get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself. @united I\\'ll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed. @United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-( @united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight... @united yes still need assistance I don\\'t have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections ! @united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive. @united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty. @united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.\\nIf I am no show, you\\'ll know why! Ridiculous. @united you\\'re just using automated  responses and don\\'t have the decency to actually care/respond @united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service @united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It\\'s ok! @united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone @united no claim number. Haven\\'t been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone? @united worst service ever 😈 @united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option? @united can\\'t believe United can\\'t find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice @united I am furious.  You\\'re firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United @united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain. @united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡... @united sorry, I hate united. i won\\'t get to see my family until Thursday @United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck @united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you? @united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight. @United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines. @united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders. @united I travel a lot and I get it. You\\'re still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on. @united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed. @United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines. @united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please. @united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I\\'ve flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible @united you\\'d learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want @united customer service 👎 @united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O\\'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air @united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled. .@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2 @united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now? @united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won\\'t leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened @united Supposedly, they\\'re out for delivery. I\\'ll believe it when I see it. @united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :) @united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I\\'d like assistance in getting compensated for my bag. @united probably wouldn\\'t be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993 @united I can\\'t even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years. @united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation @united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet @united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I\\'m stranded away from home and work? @united you are really trying me today. @united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition. @united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting @united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can\\'t tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!! @united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta @united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don\\'t you figure out a solution and announce once? @united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee. @united who can tell me where they are? @united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful. @united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don\\'t even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats! @united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she\\'d been txting on @united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude @united I don\\'t see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure. @united I don\\'t need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats @united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic! @united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn\\'t miss my transfer... @united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success. @united I\\'m not this person, but I\\'ve been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home. @united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up! @united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I\\'ve been in EWR for 24hrs now. @united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline. @united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren\\'t honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail @united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here? @united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept @united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke @united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus. @united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter @united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused @united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no. @United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!! @united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error. @united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate. @united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service! @united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it. @united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can\\'t? @united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I\\'m on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed! @united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane. @united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful. @united my mother\\'s flight was delayed from phl-ord. We\\'re on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh @united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really! @united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home @united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient. @united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response @united I somehow think I\\'m going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we\\'ll see. @united of course I need help.  I\\'ve been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX. @united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy? @united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem @united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven\\'t heard anything about it since, when do I get it back? @united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!! @united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don\\'t notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant. @united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation. .@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating. @united + that\\'s the gist of what the flight attendant told her. @united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? + @united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger\\'s shoulders. + @united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business. @united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh @united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can\\'t accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY! @united\\'s first-class #cockup\\nhttp://t.co/oh7CFv7DHR @united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive! @united Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Sg7IQqFVsO @united why am i mot getting my refund? .@united nothing apparently. I\\'ve flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks. @united didn\\'t get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard... @united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD) @united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last... @united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations @United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE @united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies @united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won\\'t work #hopeless .@united call my work and tell them it\\'s your fault I\\'m Late Flight @United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on @united i have items of sentimental value that I\\'m heartbroken are missing @united still waiting for a reply @united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn\\'t there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!! Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united @united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why @united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can\\'t yet tell what any problems are except see snow. @united I like delays less than you because I\\'m the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher @united and don\\'t hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion @united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait @united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am. @SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour. @SouthwestAir although I\\'m not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook @SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can\\'t get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!! @SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!! @SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care @SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix. @SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A @SouthwestAir my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I\\'m 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset. @SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do? @SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can\\'t even leverage it #bullshit @SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could\\'ve drove home in the time I\\'ve been waiting @SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven\\'t gotten through @SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again. @SouthwestAir oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. 😡😡😡😡😤😤😤 @SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree @SouthwestAir they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having @SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience. @SouthwestAir thx but I\\'ll be expecting a credit for this leg. @SouthwestAir  appreciate y\\'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac @SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous...... @SouthwestAir have u seen any of the messages the past hour ? @SouthwestAir went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help? @SouthwestAir I\\'m so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn\\'t help! @SouthwestAir its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won\\'t get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh @SouthwestAir your phone service sucks @SouthwestAir are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I\\'m on... @SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail @SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane @SouthwestAir trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can\\'t do it online-was directed to call. Help? @SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online? @SouthwestAir Yo, I\\'m trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, \"Unable to price\". Please help! @SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir @SouthwestAir had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain @SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest. @SouthwestAir I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds. @SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok. @SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ @SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again. @SouthwestAir need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL @SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch @SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what\\'s up with that? @SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal @SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2 @SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points? @SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed. @SouthwestAir freezing in the plane @SouthwestAir where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are @SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon @SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us @SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first @SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable @SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn\\'t work on mobile? It\\'s a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr @SouthwestAir if you\\'re going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn\\'t take the length of the flight to open a page @SouthwestAir your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it\\'s changed, so is that reliable information? @SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays. @SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED @SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is.... @SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go? @SouthwestAir and thx for not responding @SouthwestAir I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that? @SouthwestAir Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze @SouthwestAir how come I\\'m not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site? @SouthwestAir mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook @SouthwestAir my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30 @SouthwestAir flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash @SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed? @SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can\\'t be the only one with this issue on flight 1625 @SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing. @SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can\\'t be done online? @SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won\\'t take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful. @SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You\\'re killing me smalls....... @SouthwestAir I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice @SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed @SouthwestAir Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy. @SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle? @SouthwestAir Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn\\'t my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web? @SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone. @SouthwestAir why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd? @SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy @SouthwestAir I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX! @SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees @SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation @SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?! @SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky @SouthwestAir I \"heart\" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations. @SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate. @SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay @SouthwestAir my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn\\'t get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS! @SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight. @SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can\\'t because meeting was today. @SouthwestAir when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM? @SouthwestAir I luv y\\'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna. @SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes @SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers @SouthwestAir it\\'s just the principle - it\\'s hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn\\'t give me anything #wrongiswrong @SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn\\'t use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f @SouthwestAir three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems @SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me @SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear @SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night. @SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might \"know\" but don\\'t show it. @SouthwestAir darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I\\'m sure? @SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. \\n\\n#filmjobnoequipment \\n#nowarmclothes @SouthwestAir you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment @SouthwestAir way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool @SouthwestAir wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson @SouthwestAir When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international? @SouthwestAir making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah @SouthwestAir we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don\\'t let them travel @SouthwestAir won\\'t let me send a DM because they don\\'t follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy @SouthwestAir your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane. @SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can\\'t believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked @SouthwestAir here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up. @SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don\\'t say anything at all! @SouthwestAir disappointed in the \\'service\\' I\\'ve received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT @SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what\\'s worse, 2nd time this winter. @SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ @SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service @SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin @SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don\\'t upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot @SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service. @SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven\\'t received text updates about flight time change. Don\\'t offer if you won\\'t use it @SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy @SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed @SouthwestAir @TaylorLumsden Taylor.  U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh? @SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight @SouthwestAir oh, ok!  all good!  looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit!  thanks! @SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can\\'t get on the Internet?! Ugh... @SouthwestAir hasn\\'t evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable @SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights. @SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!! @SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don\\'t see any albums. @SouthwestAir my question is this: what\\'s up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats? @SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don\\'t even know why it\\'s behind schedule. @SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/ @SouthwestAir prove it @SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really? @SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don\\'t help. Results matter and it\\'s proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that. @SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7 @SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I\\'m playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL. @SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury. @SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action. @SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio? @SouthwestAir how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt? @SouthwestAir right? We\\'re delayed so I\\'m crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows? @SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded\\nOnly 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding @SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer! @SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can\\'t load an email. @SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149 @SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!? @SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions @SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm????? @SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I\\'ve experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?! @SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel @SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans @SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty @SouthwestAir I can. Doesn\\'t it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them? @SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice. @SouthwestAir weren\\'t too \"sincere\" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.. @SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck? @SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip @SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow. @SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq @SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I\\'ve been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back? @SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha @SouthwestAir yeah they\\'re somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting. @SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable @SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition @SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy @SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don\\'s see it in the open schedule. :/ @SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It\\'s a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time. @SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me. @SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn\\'t support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness @SouthwestAir  how many others didn\\'t know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ? @SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it\\'s being abused @ every airport... @SouthwestAir it\\'s not disappointment, it\\'s a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it\\'s becoming a problem that\\'s pushing @SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight? @SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :) @SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn\\'t room and I\\'m screwed. @SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag. @SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0 @SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight. @SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat? @SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail @SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her. @SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours. @SouthwestAir Wasn\\'t able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2 @SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage. @SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn\\'t stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!! @SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help! @SouthwestAir I did. Still haven\\'t heard a thing. @SouthwestAir I hope this isn\\'t a real life scene out of the movie \\'Flight\\' ..... @SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040 @SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :| @SouthwestAir I\\'ve had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don\\'t care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon @SouthwestAir on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here? @SouthwestAir I\\'m going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying @SouthwestAir What\\'s up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I\\'ve been on for over 15 min. @SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight @SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag?? @SouthwestAir, you\\'re really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB @SouthwestAir Please get back with my about my airtran credit Q4VNMB, I call and I\\'m being told that I will, but I never get email/call back @SouthwestAir pleaseeee resume direct flights from FLL to PHL. I don\\'t want to fly with anyone else 😩😫😢 @SouthwestAir what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward @southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights? @SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable @SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $\\'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn\\'t sell out. @SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable. @SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it\\'s not working. 800 series plane so not like it\\'s an old plane. @SouthwestAir #1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I\\'m watching free TV it works but won\\'t hardly access any websites - including your own. @SouthwestAir almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds. @SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, \"well, that system is about dead.\" She didn\\'t understand @SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow. @SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy @SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don\\'t even know where it is, Please help. @SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you\\'ve got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC @SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I\\'m now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this! @SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet @SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail @SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson @SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents\\' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.) @SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx @SouthwestAir you\\'re right, I do. I\\'ve been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night. @SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking @SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it\\'s not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now. @SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪 @SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass. @SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business. @SouthwestAir now I don\\'t get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted @SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me. @SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn\\'t remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over. @SouthwestAir It was never really \"lost\" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren\\'t sure what flight but I have it - TY! @SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest @SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can\\'t even call them? 617-653-3040 @SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time. .@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service @SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕 @SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal? @SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2\\nPaid for early bird and sat in back @SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night. @SouthwestAir it\\'s ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago @SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can\\'t seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help? @SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail. @SouthwestAir I understand. But it\\'s consistent, and been consistent for years. It\\'s known around the country. @SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me. @SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn\\'t help me bc i can\\'t get it until I\\'m flying back home. @SouthwestAir For example, can\\'t pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight? @SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust. @SouthwestAir Don\\'t apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM. @SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣 @SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information @SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines. @SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I\\'m last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$! @SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan. @SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight\\'s Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies. @SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again @SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar. But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for \"weather.\"  We flew home on weatherless @united. @SouthwestAir really shouldn\\'t offer sweeps if your link isn\\'t going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN @SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can\\'t be done online? @SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn\\'t lit $24 on fire @SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again! @SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available @southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can\\'t load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable. @SouthwestAir You\\'ve inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit @SouthwestAir everyones flights who were Cancelled Flightled today DESERVE 1 @SouthwestAir How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on. @SouthwestAir wifi is the worst $8 investment I have ever made. @SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting @SouthwestAir couldn\\'t be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI. @SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous @SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag. @SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven\\'t received it. @SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time. @SouthwestAir I\\'m gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!! @SouthwestAir I\\'m a huge fan and give y\\'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi! @SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work?? @SouthwestAir now I can\\'t board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I\\'ve been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday @SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained @SouthwestAir been sleeping on the floor like I\\'m homeless and now delayed flights because the equipment isn\\'t working! I have a job to get2 @SouthwestAir you guys should stop doing service in Denver it\\'s horrible I get stuck here every time! I\\'ve been here almost 24hrs @SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID. @SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness @SouthwestAir we\\'ve been at the gate a long time. We\\'re gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! http://t.co/qRXvZFrD1Z @SouthwestAir Sort of, but I\\'m arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all... @SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white? @SouthwestAir just sent it @SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue @SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler @SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!! @SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it\\'s Monday afternoon! @SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service! @SouthwestAir your \"complimentary\" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn\\'t wish this on my worst enemy! @SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped @SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr! @SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What\\'s the process for damage reimbursement? @SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed @SouthwestAir - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We\\'re stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again @SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney @SouthwestAir our flight is delayed till tomorrow curse the weather @SouthwestAir now I\\'m so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I\\'m tiny. 😂💁 @SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn\\'t zoom out or scroll to touch \"Buy\" @SouthwestAir it was not - still don\\'t know where skis are and cannot get a call back from bag svc at airport (left several msgs) @SouthwestAir wife\\'s flight to DAL just got Cancelled Flightled. What does she do to find options to get back home?  1708 PHX-&gt;DAL @SouthwestAir thanks for the response - flight time has passed - rebooked now &lt;3 &lt;3 RT @SouthwestAir! @danihampton Sorry to hear about the WiFi connection, Dani.

Flight was Cancelled Flightled and today is all booked so had to go with another carrier. :( @SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved? @SouthwestAir here\\'s a first..both pilot and first officer in galley during flight... @SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes. @SouthwestAir waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew @SouthwestAir    Promotion e-mail today (Vegas and Jamaica) has a defective link for the Vegas sweepstakes...it times out with error. @SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss @SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I\\'ve never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove @SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O @SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don\\'t cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI @SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali @SouthwestAir What\\'s happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali @SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you\\'d have less issues #justsaying @SouthwestAir we didn\\'t nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can\\'t change into clean clothes @SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point? @SouthwestAir I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service.

Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can\\'t find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE. @SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile.

She\\'s off to FL @SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund. @SouthwestAir #tfw1 @JimCramer @AARP TY-Spent total of 3 hrs and 20 mins holding. Cell battery died. Finally made arrangements w kind Rep @SouthwestAir no after 75 mins of hold, I finally hung up! Ridiculous wait times.

Can you DM? @SouthwestAir flights from sunny SFO delayed for hours and others Cancelled Flightled left and right with little updates. Any help @SouthwestAir? @SouthwestAir Please explain to reps, ignoring a technical issue and passing the buck is not a good business model. Lucky limited to 140 @SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid \\'b\\'. Feel ripped off. @SouthwestAir Please start charging for carryon luggage. #CarryOnBagsSlowEverybodyDown @SouthwestAir No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience @SouthwestAir will you please start offering services out of @triflight and @AshevilleAir to other airports.. Have to drive 3-4 hrs to use u @SouthwestAir Flying now from JAX to DEN and I paid $8 for wifi that barely is functional.  Couldn\\'t do work if I wanted to.  Never again. @SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I\\'ve been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human @SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird! @SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing @SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn\\'t work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model. @SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can\\'t it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation @SouthwestAir y airline I fly with, but haven\\'t seen anything like this yet! @SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice @SouthwestAir - 800 is not int\\'l friendly @SouthwestAir 4-4 in horrible customer service. Empty seats in early flight wantcharge me double to get home early instead the usual Late Flight @SouthwestAir can you answer the phone so I can change my flight plans. Srsly. @SouthwestAir you could be a little more accommodating with extending my flight credit.Whats 10 extra days!#notahappytraveler @SouthwestAir if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I\\'d prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey @SouthwestAir what does relay concerns really mean &amp; how/why do u keep letting people on flights with bags larger than u state are allowabl? @SouthwestAir how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I\\'ve earned points but don\\'t see em @SouthwestAir If you could get me on the 12:15 flight! My 10:10 has been delayed until 1:05. @SouthwestAir couldn\\'t make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I\\'m out. @SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus. @SouthwestAir FJBFSC  all I need is receipt showing the 776.20 charge I have on my Amex not the 656.xx that I keep getting sent @SouthwestAir what do I need to do when TSA pre doesn\\'t show for a flight of mine? @SouthwestAir  getting the run around today with customer service &amp; disconnected customer relations # given twice. Help!!! @SouthwestAir have been doing that for hours already @SouthwestAir After flying Delta this week, GoGo was so good. The tweet I sent you didn\\'t even send until we landed - that\\'s how bad it was @SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh @SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!! @SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation. @SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them. @southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed? @SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad. @SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn\\'t working properly my Nexus 5. @SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn\\'t believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it? @SouthwestAir What\\'s up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :( @SouthwestAir it\\'s too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!! @SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating \"Fuck you\" to your customers. I\\'ll be shopping for a new airline ASAP @SouthwestAir yeah... that\\'s not what happened. I\\'m really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you. @SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. \\'Thanks\\' for the voucher in return for lost bag. @SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher??? @SouthwestAir that\\'s bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal. @SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I\\'m connected. @Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me? @SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I\\'m taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway. @SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI. @SouthwestAir hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!! @Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?! @SouthwestAir luxury! Only 40 people on this flight. I\\'m going to get spoiled. @southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue @SouthwestAir unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help! @SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch. @SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75???? @SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I\\'m thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY? @SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what\\'s up with that ?? @SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated @SouthwestAir Why do airlines change ticket prices in the middle of the day\\n#annoyed @SouthwestAir #delayed again! You\\'re killing me Late Flightly! @SouthwestAir Another delay. Wow @SouthwestAir I don\\'t want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long. @SouthwestAir I can\\'t begin to tell you how slow my plane\\'s wifi is. I can\\'t even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for?? @SouthwestAir BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin\\' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou @SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven\\'t even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe? @SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we\\'ve been sitting in the runway for 20 min 😥 #fail @SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic @SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6 @SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA @SouthwestAir link doesn\\'t work @SouthwestAir it\\'d be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple \"no\" would do; I just want to know. :) @southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but... @SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn\\'t useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM @SouthwestAir you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6 @SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn\\'t work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load @SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter @SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log. @SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can\\'t get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels @SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min.... @SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice @SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight! @SouthwestAir why can\\'t you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV? @SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent. @SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it. @SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don\\'t remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn\\'t delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc! @SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn\\'t make sense to me. @SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on. @SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk @SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND @SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job. @SouthwestAir I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook. @SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we\\'ll be sure to fill out your survey!! @SouthwestAir lets chat about flights to and from BWI and the Carolina area... Can a girl get break? I\\'ve had to resort to USAir 😖 2 a day?! @SouthwestAir, remember me? Wouldn\\'t let me on 3:05pm flight (seats available). Now my 7:40 flight is delayed. Worst airline. #badservice @SouthwestAir next up: enforcing your boarding procedure. @SouthwestAir Roger wilco. @SouthwestAir yall say flt 4200 is on time, yet we haven\\'t boarded for a 3:35 departure b/c we are waiting on a new crew. Why the subterfuge @SouthwestAir Did yall get rid of the Austin to Cabo flights all together? There\\'s zero non-stop in Aug and Sept @SouthwestAir my Flt was delayed, scheduled to miss my connection, can I get some help? 8HH4P2 @SouthwestAir I didn\\'t say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same. @SouthwestAir flight # 317 @SouthwestAir don\\'t ever tweet me again @SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn\\'t issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you\\'re 6\\'4. @SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever @SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It\\'s a lowercase team day. @SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included. @SouthwestAir my trip is a month away...why do you consider it \"around the corner\"? Is that a setting I can change? @SouthwestAir I tried again with your in-flight wifi #fail @SouthwestAir Flight Booking Problems all my Late Flight summer travel! Did the AUS-CUN direct flight disappear? @SouthwestAir you\\'re killing me!! always #delayed from #SanDiego to #SF!! #ugh @SouthwestAir almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem? @SouthwestAir experiencing the worst customer service ever currently. Waited for CS rep, then put \"on hold\" but actually was hung up on. @SouthwestAir why doesn\\'t your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline @SouthwestAir reviewing your oversize policy. Hardcase golfbags are free if under weight. How do we add guitars and instruments to the list? @SouthwestAir @saianel You could have just said \"We don\\'t know\" @SouthwestAir Why can\\'t I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends! @SouthwestAir can\\'t DM you without you following me... @SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :( @SouthwestAir Yes I can. But you guys should get your act together. @SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!! @SouthwestAir thanks a lot for sending a \"special deal\" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners @SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program. @SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee\\' can\\'t be helped. @SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call @SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer. @SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won\\'t have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around @SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another \"go-to\" airliner @SouthwestAir What\\'s with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. 😑 @SouthwestAir A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives??? @SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn\\'t part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn\\'t know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat. @SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter @SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren\\'t providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER @SouthwestAir if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight.. @SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again.. @SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It\\'s scheduled for 455 @SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You\\'ve ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation. @SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I\\'ve been delayed 3 times .. @SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation. @SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious. @SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment. @SouthwestAir Why doesn\\'t mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account. @SouthwestAir no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route? @southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I\\'d be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7 @SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular. @SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn\\'t there be some sort of compensation? @SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I\\'ve had. What\\'s up? @SouthwestAir, got \"duped\" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won\\'t give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful @SouthwestAir, real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice @SouthwestAir I already follow you and can\\'t DM because u need to follow me back @SouthwestAir, rude customer svc, won\\'t accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice @SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw. @SouthwestAir having trouble reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight. no one picking up phones and your site isn\\'t working. @SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100\\'s of ppl waiting @SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO @SouthwestAir @jlittle100 Double up with this comment. PHL to anywhere South Florida is GONE GONE GONE. Hello US Air @SouthwestAir . I don\\'t like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad. @SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven\\'t received a response. @SouthwestAir I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead. @SouthwestAir I wish I would\\'ve known so I could\\'ve slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands... @SouthwestAir nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor @SouthwestAir used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. 😔 why...so... few...direct...flights? @SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback. @SouthwestAir great. My flight is delayed three hours. Now my friend has to wait for me at the airport for hours on her birthday. 😒👎 @SouthwestAir @thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he\\'s not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ? @SouthwestAir Is my friend lucky enough to see #DestinationDragons live on his birthday? He\\'s been a fan for years @thirty_lives @SouthwestAir when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :( @SouthwestAir is main supporter of play where Jesus is portrayed as homosexual partner of Judas and who performs a “gay wedding” #boycott @SouthwestAir you\\'re giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it\\'s during my birthday!!!! @SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday. @SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won\\'t be loyal anymore. @SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ☀️&amp; races in Daytona @SouthwestAir Learn how to give folks on multiple flights the same day boarding position at least if you can\\'t give them  boarding passes. @SouthwestAir I\\'m getting leathery from the heat on 4251 before I even get to Vegas.... @SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.😭 @SouthwestAir how it feels on flight 4251 http://t.co/JM8gQ1KGrF @SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member @SouthwestAir love how \"friendly\" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes @SouthwestAir hates guitar players. Chgd for oversize AND extra bag on my acoustic guitar. Epic fail. @SouthwestAir Flt 463 San Jose, CA -&gt; Denver, CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up! @SouthwestAir I spoke to soon... My bag was lost.. :( @SouthwestAir humor aside, we\\'ve been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can\\'t be loaded correctly. What gives? @SouthwestAir We\\'ve been sitting at the gate for two hours waiting for bags to be loaded... I\\'m telling Herb. @SouthwestAir had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order. @SouthwestAir sat on a plane for 2+ hrs on 2/15! Then we finally took off.. :( @SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flighted tonight and was told I won\\'t receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy? @SouthwestAir I fly SWA a lot - ALWAYS purchase EB and NEVER past A30... Rethinking the SWA process.  Very misleading. @SouthwestAir today you sporadically changed my flight departure 5 times &amp; left two hours Late Flight. Uncharacteristic of u http://t.co/TXhYJ40llG @SouthwestAir Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room. @SouthwestAir have a flight from Oakland to SNA at 7:30, and I asked if I can take 5:30, even there are 5 empty sests. Answer is \"No\". :( @SouthwestAir could care more about their customer, if there is a reasonable request :( @SouthwestAir I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork? @SouthwestAir Thnx. Hopefully it\\'s just on the nxt flight up. I\\'ve got 3 shows this wknd. Worst case I\\'ll just turn my sweatshirt inside out @SouthwestAir I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight @SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything @SouthwestAir your app isnt working and i take off in like two hours help @SouthwestAir why can\\'t you take me to Knoxville?? yall are my fav #help @SouthwestAir I understand weather is not your fault, but as a frequent flyer I expected better customer service.

Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS. @SouthwestAir @LeeAnnHealey I was all, yeah sale fares! I got places to fly! Oh damn, right, I live where SWA doesn\\'t fly. #why @SouthwestAir it took ages for one snapchat story to load. one. ONE. I will demolish you @SouthwestAir lost my sunglasses &amp; case on a flight 3933 last night - is there a lost &amp; found? @SouthwestAir your WiFi is shit. fix that up before I jump out of the closest bloody fucking emergency exit. @SouthwestAir We need help changing a name on a company reservation....We tried calling customer relations but there is a busy signal. @SouthwestAir alas, it was pretty full so we had to entertain ourselves with witty repartee ... @SouthwestAir I am trying to book another flight and apply my credits that I had from another flight but I can\\'t find them. @SouthwestAir So frustrated with my experience with #Southwest. 18 hours trapped in Denver bc of mechanical problems. #worstcustomerservice @SouthwestAir we\\'ve now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything. @SouthwestAir we have to stay in Chicago overnight and meet up with our bags there. I hope they stay put and don\\'t get put on a flight. @SouthwestAir are bicycles that the 62\", 50lbs criteria free or bikes are automatically $75/each way? The FAQ page isn\\'t very clear to me. @SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz @SouthwestAir Open more kiosks at \\nAustin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really? @SouthwestAir pls help me get this resolved &amp; reimbursement made.  gracias, rico; pls send me private msg with phone number or email address @SouthwestAir A-list preferred line phone wait was 15 minutes. I hung up, not feeling A-list-ey! @SouthwestAir How do I stop getting credit card apps? I already have a card! @SouthwestAir TSA Pre isn\\'t showing up on my boarding passes and I\\'ve followed all of the steps. Please help. @SouthwestAir if you guys fuck this up again  I will never forgive you @SouthwestAir I\\'m smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat. @SouthwestAir I\\'m miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I\\'m in 1A btw. @SouthwestAir bad weather and multiple Cancelled Flighted flights has us all scared!  Noted for next time. @SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by. @SouthwestAir doesn\\'t want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG @SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really? @SouthwestAir #worstthingever 2days Late Flightr our lost bag was fedexed somewhere. Do you know where cause we don\\'t &amp; it was delivered somewhere @SouthwestAir how do i know that my information is not found on other people\\'s account?  I can see someone else\\'s reservation, rr # and trip @SouthwestAir I don\\'t have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour @SouthwestAir Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international @SouthwestAir looks like my 1 yr anni trip has been replaced w someone\\'s itinerary. Worried abt who can c my flight http://t.co/BApE6RuMNE @SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR. @SouthwestAir #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to @Delta thank you @SouthwestAir, a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather. 5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We\\'ll have you in the air shortly!^RS” @SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don\\'t suck so much @SouthwestAir I\\'m sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I\\'ve learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness! @SouthwestAir it\\'s the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!! @SouthwestAir it was this one but looks like the problem is now fixed. https://t.co/CFI1E3KXA9 .@SouthwestAir 3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate @SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked. @SouthwestAir tried to enter that rapid rewards contest link on facebook but all my browsers kept popping up security warnings 4 it. @SouthwestAir Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend. @SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn\\'t want to wait their turn can get a slip? @SouthwestAir it\\'s ok...I forgive you guys. @SouthwestAir now it\\'s delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse @SouthwestAir Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can\\'t book it online. When will this be available? @SouthwestAir Service rep didn\\'t say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it. @SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on @SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don\\'t think they\\'re as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into. @SouthwestAir Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing. @SouthwestAir Didn\\'t see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before. @SouthwestAir after a long wait of over an hour my mother\\'s bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help @SouthwestAir when will sw return to customer service?  Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us. @SouthwestAir your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL @SouthwestAir No I have not. @SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday @SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore. @SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn\\'t our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭 @southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons @SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs! @SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people\\'s travel plans yesterday @SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it\\'s not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated? @SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes? @southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay @SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don\\'t want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight. @SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that\\'s trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns. @SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero. @SouthwestAir By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time. @SouthwestAir Therefore, since I\\'ve received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow. @SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I\\'m astounded at the lack of concern about customer\\'s flying experiences. @SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I\\'ve ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse @SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection @SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused. @SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do @SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour\\'s wait. No apologies, no explanation. @SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage. @SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour! @SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight @SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what\\'s with all the carry-on\\'s? #packingayak @BrianReganComic @SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate @SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL. @SouthwestAir when will you be accepting reservations past August 7? @SouthwestAir FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said \"well i was Late Flight\" @SouthwestAir I just sent a screen shot of the incident report. @SouthwestAir I couldn\\'t fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :( @SouthwestAir Flight 4110 MCO to ISP delayed. Any details on why? @SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb @SouthwestAir why is your website downnnnn :( ugh @SouthwestAir will you please tell me if I\\'ll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I\\'ve been tryin for 3 days now to leave @SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why? “@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I\\'m so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW” I\\'ve been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH @SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It\\'s 1:30 in the morning. @SouthwestAir where are our bags?\\nWe have a tv show to film!! @SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled @SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags @SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft @SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a \"baggage error\" #sarcasm @SouthwestAir Engadget Theverge Wired reddit @southwestair,  Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID @SouthwestAir when you\\'re on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu http://t.co/tEFHpuWMdJ @SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport.

Plz help get it back. @SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait! @SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone. @SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab @SouthwestAir My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is! @SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks. @SouthwestAir I did ....it\\'s just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted. @SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight @SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE @SouthwestAir can\\'t believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow. .@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn\\'t solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods. @SouthwestAir you\\'re 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines. @SouthwestAir she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf#\\xa0FVF9YW  SWRR#\\xa0298033455 @SouthwestAir very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!! @SouthwestAir  you are over 40, please start acting your age and stop with the short-shorts! @SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable. @SouthwestAir Why won\\'t you let me leave Newark!? @SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading! @SouthwestAir According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from \"uneventful\" with heavy (panic) breaking to @SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again? @SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to Cancelled Flight all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM @SouthwestAir not very helpful trying to get out of Nashville.Should waive change fee for 2/18. @SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn’t a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now @SouthwestAir took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it\\'s not here; can we expect compensation? @SouthwestAir took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy. @SouthwestAir No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked. @SouthwestAir even with the 50$ voucher for picking up my bag @SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again @SouthwestAir yeah they told me it would be on the next flight.

All I need is the link to the chart that has routes, time @SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options? @SouthwestAir kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500 @SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days? @SouthwestAir I\\'m an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago. @SouthwestAir too bad I\\'m getting this memo: \"Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online.\" #FUSTURATED @SouthwestAir almost 2 hours on hold, 2 hours of my life I can\\'t get back.... Thanks http://t.co/IyUZM2PUVS @SouthwestAir discount for three delays? @SouthwestAir tried online and told I must call b/c of modifications to my reservation. Been on hold for almost 2 hours. @SouthwestAir has the WORST customer service of any airline I\\'ve ever flown. @SouthwestAir I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours. @SouthwestAir Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance? @SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight out of BNA today. Been on hold for an hour. 😠 #frustrated! @SouthwestAir tried to rebook online but it says that I have to pay $200 for difference in price. Please help @SouthwestAir I\\'m showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away? @SouthwestAir can\\'t update my flight online bc it\\'s been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold. @SouthwestAir Guys for real. I\\'ve been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back. @SouthwestAir the last 4 times I\\'ve arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays @SouthwestAir been on hold for &gt;30 minutes about my Cancelled Flightled flight. Still not talked to anyone and flight is soon. What gives? @SouthwestAir Hoping you answer the phone today? @SouthwestAir husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can\\'t confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts! @SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH @SouthwestAir on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home. @SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can\\'t I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i @SouthwestAir allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared @SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won\\'t let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help @SouthwestAir won\\'t answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone @SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad. @SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing? @SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it\\'s coming, then not. @JetBlue They weren\\'t on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us! @JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat! @JetBlue Hey guys, why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? http://t.co/1syWlmTZek @JetBlue 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can\\'t move bc we didn\\'t pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap @JetBlue ’s Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw @JetBlue they booked me for tomorrow. It\\'s $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help. @JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I\\'d lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight. @JetBlue ive tried on my phone and laptop :( @JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 more👺 @JetBlue just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it. @JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we\\'ve received for our \"on time\" flight 1170 out of MCO @JetBlue I\\'ve spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn\\'t help. I probably won\\'t be using JetBlue again. @JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200. @JetBlue Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame. @JetBlue can\\'t book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in \"Verified by Visa\" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to @sxsw @JetBlue luggage fees? won\\'t b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter @JetBlue it\\'s poop and barely works @JetBlue your wifi is a lie and i hate you @JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :( @jetblue having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting \"We are not able to sign you in\" msg. @JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me. @JetBlue Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen! @JetBlue Need your help. I\\'m moving to DC &amp; I want to book a one way fare on your website. It won\\'t seem to let me. Am I missing something? @JetBlue \\'s Once upon a sale that does not include BTV, as usual!  #jetbluehatesbtv @JetBlue can\\'t link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn\\'t answering..don\\'t make me fly @Delta again, dont do it! @JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising. @JetBlue I just DM\\'d you! @JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate. @JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today. @JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm @JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice @JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound @JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :\\'( @JetBlue, I\\'ve experienced better service making connecting flight from @united and @AmericanAir #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr @JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can\\'t fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning. @JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I\\'m sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine @JetBlue the worst flying experience I\\'ve ever suffered through. I\\'d appreciate my money back. @JetBlue my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created. @JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can\\'t help. Need help with family pooling asap. @JetBlue customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can\\'t join mine for a year???  Help me fix please. @JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful. @JetBlue we have. Twice. They said they can\\'t dim those lights. But they did on our first flight. @JetBlue JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps @JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm. @JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we\\'ve been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3 @JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3 @JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me. @JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn\\'t report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner? @JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner? @JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people\\'s bags? Security cameras? Anything? @JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours) @JetBlue absolutely no worries. I\\'m just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople @JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!! @jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER! @JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!! @JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe?? @JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he\\'ll is your companies problem? @JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane @JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board @JetBlue that\\'s not a answer! See what you started now @nytimes RT @JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. http://t.co/atd2Sm8HF4 .@JetBlue Navigating through 2 rebooks due to flu &amp; ice to visit my Mother.  Your CS reps have been so very helpful, patient and friendly. @JetBlue well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time. @JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy @JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for \"weather\" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation? @JetBlue I guess you weren\\'t able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow @JetBlue we\\'re home, you guys recovered, now we can laugh about it and the extra day in barbados. Will you open Cuba soon? @JetBlue Am I the only one who had to look that up? I must be getting old...\\n #damn @JetBlue flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can\\'t seem to rebook me. They can\\'t even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted. @JetBlue does transferring trueblue points within family pooling members cost $? This is after having set up contribution-to-pool already. @JetBlue Gotcha... but \"lessening the delay\" ... that part\\'s not happening, right? Social agencies, this is why we can\\'t have nice things. @JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. http://t.co/QRxz0bGbtq “@JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. http://t.co/7iM9rHIvyR” Plz stop @JetBlue @MrJustyn I heard companies were studying popular lingo for advertising but this is just depressing and embarrassing.

I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don\\'t fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_- @JetBlue received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers. @JetBlue three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen.

Too bad we\\'re at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags. @JetBlue I believe it\\'s Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn\\'t available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today. @JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what\\'s a little delay right. @JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner @JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:\"your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins\" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer! @JetBlue All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised. @JetBlue nope. The \"regular\" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS. @JetBlue Thank you, but that isn\\'t really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site. @JetBlue I would like to communicate directly with a \"Customer Experience\" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address? @JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF @JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun @JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset @JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane. @JetBlue I don\\'t want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :((( @JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight? @JetBlue lol at your \"estimated departure time.\" Plane hasn\\'t even started boarding yet. You can\\'t even get your delays right. @JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening. @JetBlue said they haven\\'t started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can\\'t find $100 outfit. 😒 @JetBlue yeah I\\'m aware of that. Hence my original msg to you. @JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster. @JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn\\'t make the flight less delayed. @JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven\\'t contacted me yet. @JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta. @jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better @JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting \"Webpage not available\" after submitting online form @jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We\\'re just sittin\\' here on the tarmac  waiting. @JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better @JetBlue Rats, that\\'s a bummer! @JetBlue is so sloooooow today @jetblue terrible landing on 915 @JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS. @JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people. @JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was \"There is nothing we can do\" idk if that\\'s what you mean @JetBlue Didn\\'t find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail. @jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail @JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail @jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!! @JetBlue 2 words: \"staff training.\" What a joke- @JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don\\'t hold it.  5 minutes. @JetBlue any idea what\\'s going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement @JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a \"courtesy report\" @JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today? @JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man! @JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/ @JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i @JetBlue didn\\'t work. Fly-fi plus couldn\\'t access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed @JetBlue 👍. I think I\\'ll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;) @JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not. @JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed? @JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that\\'s literally why I picked y\\'all over the competitors. @JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous. @JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi??? @JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that\\'s just no @JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :( @JetBlue \"Goodwill\" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136 @JetBlue thank you! Hopefully it\\'s soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23 @JetBlue hard when you\\'re with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this @JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome! @JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people? @JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had \\'perks\\' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I\\'m carrying it on 😒 @JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous @JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I\\'ll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris... @JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now. @JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!! @JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn\\'t make up for the money lost. @JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can\\'t be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice @JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk. Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9 @JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems? @JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed @JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible! @JetBlue @julesdameron \"Considering?\" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality @JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars .@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that\\'s silly of you. guess we\\'re \"watching\" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars @JetBlue I\\'ve heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant @JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn\\'t allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification @JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t @JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What\\'s going on? @jetblue I\\'m dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given @JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is. @JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA?? @JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9\\'8\" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports. @JetBlue your gif game is strong. @JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch @JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc? @JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying @JetBlue your crew didn\\'t say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers @JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether @JetBlue I\\'m going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue @JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG @JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn\\'t help bc going on break @JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they\\'d come back but did not. @JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day. @JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I\\'ll be able to go home! @JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades? @JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned. @JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don\\'t understand why you couldn\\'t accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now. @JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed @JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks @JetBlue all day @JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right. @JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem? @JetBlue thanks for the update. \\'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back @JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home... @JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won\\'t be on this flight unless I pay more. @JetBlue If seats aren\\'t guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats. @JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for. @JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That\\'s a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi @JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper. FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - \"we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you\" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol @JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal. @JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight.. @Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!! @JetBlue I think it\\'s safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue @JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger @JetBlue anything serious I should worry about? @JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx @JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there\\'s a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a @JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don\\'t tell me you were snowbound in PBI. @JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated. @JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there\\'s a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj @JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot @JetBlue you\\'re lucky we\\'re still flying you after today\\'s landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids! @JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied? @JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don\\'t quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail @JetBlue do you REALLY think it\\'s okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu @JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your \"terms\" response is insulting.  #jetblue @JetBlue What\\'s your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air. @JetBlue if you can\\'t guarantee parents will sit with their children, don\\'t sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2 @JetBlue once you go blue you don\\'t go back @JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities? @JetBlue kids fly. Don\\'t hire people who don\\'t care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw @JetBlue I shouldn\\'t be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U @JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now. @JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn\\'t care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8 @JetBlue what\\'s up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting. @JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2 @JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you\\'re still nothing @JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK @JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you. @JetBlue you\\'ve let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven @JetBlue a 5 year old can\\'t sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4 @JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd @JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable! @JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday? @JetBlue no, I haven\\'t done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx! @JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can\\'t tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS @JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would\\'ve appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to @JetBlue You also promised to change my wife\\'s name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF? @JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2 @JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa? @JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey @JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can\\'t seem to get an answer @JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in. @JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of .... @JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination? @JetBlue You just don\\'t get it.  It\\'s not about the money, It\\'s about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue. @JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn\\'t that a bit stupid? check-in headaches! @JetBlue does not fit in 140 @JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 \"goodwill credit\" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it. @JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble?? @JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what\\'s up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs? @JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕 @JetBlue What\\'s up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness! @JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting @JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs @JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs @JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕 @JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!! @JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn\\'t have a crew to get bags! @JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours.... @JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate @JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(\\nI look forward to that do much! @JetBlue You failed. That\\'s the answer. Please don\\'t justify otherwise. @JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip. @JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ. @JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row. @JetBlue  I shouldn\\'t have to find them, they should tell us. I\\'ve flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn\\'t what it was. @JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time? @JetBlue I\\'m over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey. @JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don\\'t buy it. @JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun. @JetBlue I don\\'t believe so. That\\'s not what the team has told us. @JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight. @JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky @jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help! @JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected @JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO @JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time! @JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn\\'t even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong @JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn\\'t even been taken off the plane yet! .@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations @JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong @JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it\\'s back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology? @JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers? @JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again? @JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy... @jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed. @JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the \"T5 experience\" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month. @JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won\\'t start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs. @JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children. @JetBlue, your hold music sucks. @JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too. @JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though. @JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped. @JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!? @JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can\\'t believe I paid money for this. @JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless @JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?! @JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board @JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane! @JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You\\'re in league with big alcohol. Shame on you. @JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE @JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What\\'s the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you. @JetBlue and have empty \"help\" desks @JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures @JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there @JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO @JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We\\'re making a pact to never fly u again @JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather. @JetBlue where is the \"award winning service\"? @JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won\\'t start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk. @JetBlue how much longer to JFK open\\'s I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don\\'t have nothing @JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It\\'s 36 and sunny at JFK @JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj @JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue? @JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn\\'t get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you @JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful @JetBlue it\\'s sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What\\'s the real reason? @JetBlue it\\'s been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous. @JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers. @JetBlue what\\'s the delay if the system isn\\'t down? @JetBlue don\\'t think any1 rly knows what\\'s goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12 @JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours. @JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards @JetBlue get flight 16 into the air @JetBlue That\\'s not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn\\'t prepared. Investigation time. @JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it @JetBlue I\\'m also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT.... @JetBlue It\\'s not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate @JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight @JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board @JetBlue here\\'s part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn\\'t print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass @JetBlue That\\'s not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway. @JetBlue When it\\'s 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as \"on time\" #updateyourwebsite #489 @JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really? @JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue @JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT? @JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I\\'ll document and send details, off to Boston @JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we\\'re getting on @JetBlue isn\\'t this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job? @JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0 @JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152? @JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc! @JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!! @JetBlue  hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear.. @JetBlue flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible @jetblue all your online resources  say we\\'re on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you... @JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate. @JetBlue why don\\'t YOU tell them to update the boards?! @JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can\\'t we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY! @JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall? @JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm . @JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I\\'m not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ @JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I\\'m not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp @JetBlue ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please? @JetBlue we need an ETA please @jetblue fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free @JetBlue  I\\'m at 4:05  will be nasty in Boston. Have family driving 90 min to pick me up from Erie think flight - what if Cancelled Flighted? @JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won\\'t put you standby? #stranded @JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn\\'t ready and they\\'re waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight. @JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I\\'ll be flying blue more often. Thanks. @JetBlue won\\'t see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue??? @JetBlue suck and their customer services are the worst  whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don\\'t honor #badairline @JetBlue how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed @JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed @JetBlue that\\'s where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO? @JetBlue my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can\\'t confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int @JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol? @JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What\\'s the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..?? @JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school. @JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was @JetBlue it\\'s ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired @JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year. @JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒 @JetBlue a voucher.. I can\\'t believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face.. @JetBlue I\\'ve spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more. @JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting @JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck @JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I\\'m complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this @JetBlue I\\'m curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate @JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it\\'s a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue? @JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :( @JetBlue I am But Your customer service is Brutal. @JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies @JetBlue Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood @JetBlue thanks! Yes! order me a rum and coke and get me a hotel voucher because the floor and chairs aren\\'t so cushy here...! @JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter\\'s friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting. @jetblue I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet. @JetBlue you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional @JetBlue can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch.. @JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn\\'t be so bad but airport is closed! @JetBlue Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on @NHLonNBCSports. I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info. @JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options. @JetBlue just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC @JetBlue can we get a honest update on departure of flite 454. Been on plane with infant children @JetBlue u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence @JetBlue still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago. @JetBlue Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic. @JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE @JetBlue she did. she\\'s still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what\\'s concerning. smh @JetBlue she has...she hasn\\'t heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎 @JetBlue we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs. @JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it\\'s not - Come on @JetBlue figured it out 4 flight 2morrow. Hard to believe with oil so low, and the killing u make that even part of a hotel can\\'t be comp\\'d @JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes @JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC @JetBlue didn\\'t find them unfortunately :( but he was very helpful and took down my info incase they do get found @JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping. @JetBlue If this is customer service, then please call me. @JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!! @JetBlue lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail @JetBlue no more than half an hour wait. It\\'s unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this @JetBlue how long does it take for a bag to get to the baggage belt!!!!!#toolong of a wait @JetBlue we\\'ve been delayed and delayed here in Palm beach... Need to head to Westchester. Can you give me some info? @JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication! @JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK.  Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage @JetBlue your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone @JetBlue why haven\\'t you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous. @JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start. @JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn\\'t do anything. @JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything. @JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight? @JetBlue we tried. They\\'re not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least. @JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can\\'t fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26 @JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won\\'t provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel @JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA @JetBlue It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours. @JetBlue at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled @JetBlue I would like to send an email to Lost and Found at JetBlue JFK; I spoke to them this morning but cannot drive their today. @JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves. @JetBlue send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘 @JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved @JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70 @JetBlue I\\'ve been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise @JetBlue *cough* #awkward! @JetBlue you guys need live chat. @JetBlue it was but obviously it wasn\\'t linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it. @JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn\\'t make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/ @JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us @JetBlue continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue @JetBlue I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh! @JetBlue that sucks. Oh well. @JetBlue she\\'s standing here on her cell no announcements no info #thismosaicnothappy @JetBlue someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing @JetBlue there\\'s is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true. @JetBlue can u see what\\'s holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes @JetBlue why wouldn\\'t you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous. @JetBlue it seems I never received an ID, just a password. @JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled. @JetBlue where did my travel bank credit go?  I can\\'t call you right now. @JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work! @JetBlue yes, We have de baggage claim, I\\'m so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us 😞 please we need That baggage @JetBlue my mom\\'s baggage is lost, in fly 1557 fort lauderdale-Bogotá today, Colombian employees treated us badly , need help please @JetBlue No changes made. My son\\'s pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue @JetBlue Cancelled Flighted 😢 @JetBlue You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can\\'t print bdng pass! @JetBlue the first place but I really didn\\'t need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30 @JetBlue that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there\\'s no excuse for attitude in @JetBlue serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me @JetBlue I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a @JetBlue flying to Denver March 1st and my flight itenary keeps getting changed what the heck...booked the trip 3 months ago @jetblue had me on hold foreverrrrrr @JetBlue NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We\\'ve waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw. @JetBlue waiting for a flight to FL for 1/2 marathon tmrw 4 charity. U bumped us 2a Late Flightr flight &amp; then Cancelled FlightLED IT. How can you fix this? @JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that\\'s your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don\\'t want to chance it. #nixchangefees @JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish. “@JetBlue: @benjaminokeefe Thanks for including us on your tour! Did you pack your winter coat?”Unfortunately yes ❄️⛄️ #WereNotinCaliAnymore @jetblue is the website down? Can\\'t print boarding pass @JetBlue It\\'s not ideal, but it\\'s okay. Better Late Flight than never! :) @JetBlue yeah that\\'s all been done. Define \"incidentals\"? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste? @JetBlue so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ... @JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people @JetBlue you\\'re customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue @JetBlue now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous @JetBlue you\\'re flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/ @JetBlue says the person who hasn\\'t been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;) @JetBlue flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best. @JetBlue 1242 now?! I may cry! @JetBlue why won\\'t the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin? @JetBlue Late Flight again lost almost 3 hours of my bay area weekend not to mention two hours of unnecessary vacation time from work.  #flt348 @JetBlue yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it\\'s your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially @JetBlue appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays! @JetBlue this is awful! flight out of jfk for our honeymoon is delayed AGAIN until 1225 AM, and we lost money on a hotel now! #delayforwhat? @JetBlue flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay @JetBlue I appreciate the speedy response. But the longer you delay the more inconvenience you put on your customers. Please nix change fee! @JetBlue whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.

Very disappointed. @JetBlue just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too? @JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land @JetBlue can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would\\'ve lost it there around 445pm MT @JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu @JetBlue any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay? .@JetBlue i\\'m sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum. @JetBlue were boarding now I\\'m really not impressed. I\\'ve learnt a very valuable lesson . .@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me. .@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you. @JetBlue I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here! @JetBlue I\\'m a trying ! But I\\'m tired and getting grumpy ! @JetBlue flight1407, it\\'s been a long day! Arrived from London at 11 this morning @JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane\\'s on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight? @JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they\\'ll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats @JetBlue Jan 5? That\\'s not summer http://t.co/TpzhjX7Hbt @JetBlue No, the flight wasn\\'t until 9:51pm, but it\\'s already been delayed. @JetBlue, why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? 💔 @JetBlue ...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts? @JetBlue maybe announce the delay so we don\\'t sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off @JetBlue flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight .@JetBlue Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good.  Hire geeks. http://t.co/8MWItRi9kF @JetBlue Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can\\'t find 471 or 472 anywhere @JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. 👎 Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue @JetBlue can\\'t seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP @JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe? @JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining @JetBlue poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue @JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time.. @JetBlue No, it is one I\\'m trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International. @JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem @JetBlue what\\'s up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm? @JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!! @JetBlue what is the reason for the delay @JetBlue\\'s CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Ur60Un86gy @JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt? @JetBlue I ❤️ Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done? @JetBlue sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening\\'s is starting w delays. Why? @JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed? @JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can\\'t drive or see in my classes and they\\'re not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue @JetBlue we\\'ve been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I\\'ve had good luck, but today is really frustrating. @JetBlue something they\\'re not telling us (2) @JetBlue we\\'ve been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572 @JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof @jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me @JetBlue mechanical failure isn\\'t Boston\\' fault. @JetBlue 290 to Boston @JetBlue I’m going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome @JetBlue when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt; @JetBlue sorry to report we are stuck on Tarmac.. Being held so #notwheelsup I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I\\'ve settled some @JetBlue @JetBlue appreciate what you\\'ve done on your end to make this right, but still unhappy with initial incident. Will be calling. Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don\\'t arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue @JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line.\\nPlease see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance. @JetBlue CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided @JetBlue Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue. @JetBlue don\\'t just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. . @JetBlue I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there\\'s no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed @JetBlue   Phone agents can\\'t see same flights I see online???  Can\\'t change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue @JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi? @JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding @JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we\\'ll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/ @JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :( @JetBlue Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I\\'ll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer @JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated @JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it\\'s too Late Flight for that! @JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked. @JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I\\'m all for erring on the side of safety but it\\'s an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!! @JetBlue it\\'s ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight. @JetBlue I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this? @JetBlue your airline should have a better system to Inform your clients when their flights are Cancelled Flightled last min. 😒👺 we have schedules too @JetBlue the slowest boarding process I\\'ve ever experienced and rude customer service agents. @JetBlue needs to get its act together in #PHX @JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight @JetBlue - In CA for the weekend to attend a training camp; thanks for sending all my gear to FL; looks like this trip is a waste #nothappy @JetBlue why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more @JetBlue and stranded passengers aren\\'t being helped to get another flight? @JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!? @JetBlue I\\'m sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad... @JetBlue on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight @JetBlue #poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue @JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It\\'s comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr @JetBlue the one man in baggage office says \"I dunno\". HELP @JetBlue where is our luggage?? Flight 424 has been waiting an hour for bags! #jetblue #poorservice @JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424 @JetBlue service for baggage at JFK is incomprehensible. No employee knows where our luggage is frM flight 424 LAX to NYC ITS AN HR WAIT NOW @JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open. @JetBlue #669 stewardesses can\\'t work w/o a galley light! Back to NYC to change a light. #fromthefrontseat #jetblueBlues @anku @yaffasolin @JetBlue why do you have every channel but @ABCNetwork How are @kgonzales89 and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet! @JetBlue I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I\\'m still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues @JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet? @jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv\\'s on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email... @JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane @JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired @JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac @JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can\\'t check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it\\'s back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail @JetBlue time to reevaluate my nyc carrier. @JetBlue what\\'s going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9 @JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I\\'ll be lucky if I\\'m home by 3am @JetBlue how come you\\'re responding to everyone else and not me #wtf @JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue @JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages. @JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately @JetBlue my butt hurts. @JetBlue that\\'s what they told me half an hour ago @JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour @JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now. @JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others? @JetBlue delayed flight bummer @jetblue well, we\\'re on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔 @JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute? @JetBlue shut up an turn on the tvs/music @JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won\\'t go down again looks like I can\\'t fly JetBlue this time around, can\\'t afford that price @JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn\\'t feel safe. @JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn\\'t book right away due to all the snow; I\\'m in BOS. @JetBlue I don\\'t want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice! @JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight... @JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I\\'m looking for something a little more specific. @JetBlue if I\\'m about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed. @JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They\\'re saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are... @JetBlue walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 http://t.co/p6ucbVlv5E @JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach? @JetBlue you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now! @JetBlue not to get into semantics here but \"by\" means \"within the extent or period of; during\" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary @jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home @JetBlue not cool to announce a flight \"delay\" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help. @JetBlue what\\'s the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should\\'ve taken place 30 minutes ago. @JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What\\'s wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1 @JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site. @JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled. @JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there? @JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans @JetBlue I can\\'t do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can\\'t do that time! @JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help! @JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can\\'t be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you? @JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don\\'t have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney\\'s Magical Express this AM.I am livid! @JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather! @JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I\\'ve had with Jet Blue. @JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn\\'t have email or telephones. Right? @JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn\\'t resolved? @JetBlue No, it didn\\'t all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked. @JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone? @JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept. @JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert. @JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it. @JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService @JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I\\'m done. @JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn\\'t have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting. @JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone? @JetBlue doesn\\'t help if I have to fly on specific days @JetBlue it\\'s noting about me i m perfectly fine it\\'s the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate. @JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met. @JetBlue what\\'s up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues. @JetBlue is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux? @JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded @JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn\\'t relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee @JetBlue What\\'s up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee @JetBlue dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying. @JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer. @JetBlue Hey guys! Your Flight Booking Problems system ran my first and middle names together at time of Flight Booking Problems. Is that going to be a #TSAnightmare ? @JetBlue - He Cancelled Flightled a flight &amp; was given 2 weeks to apply travel bank credit to another flight &amp; credit was transferable @JetBlue How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X\\'s in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited .@JetBlue @ZKatcher 😂😂😂😂😂OMG. Bored &amp; read through this convo.. Seems like JetBlue is on point. @JetBlue Cancelled Flightling tickets for 3 best friends going on vacation and never told us #jetblue #fixthis #ripoff @ZKatcher @bretharold @JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly. @JetBlue trying to charge us $550 dollars cash for tickets we paid for months in advance #isthisreal #nevertoldus #jetblue #NeverAgain @JetBlue please get service started at @triflight and offer good routes lile florida upstate ny vegas etc @JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed? @JetBlue i am here - what is your resolution? @JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can\\'t assign me a seat? @JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection? @JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited @JetBlue tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue @JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain @JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport @JetBlue I\\'m on flight and no booze being served 30 min in... What gives? #lostrevenue #angryandsober #bachelorpartymishap @JetBlue I\\'ve used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again. @JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we\\'re upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice @JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls. @JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won\\'t be flying you. Point system is almost a sham. @JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer @JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid @JetBlue I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of @JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr @JetBlue claims w/ customer protection they \"will notify customers of delays, Cancelled Flightlations and diversions.\" #NotTRUE http://t.co/3oq1T4ohjl @JetBlue if there is a \"processing error\" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest @JetBlue tells me $130 paid &amp; confirmed flight will now cost me $566.80 CASH ONLY @ airport  22 hours before my flight  #RIPOFF #NoSupport @JetBlue = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed \"to mail written letter\" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8 @JetBlue No, he didn\\'t have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep? @JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name @JetBlue the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It\\'s staticy #ithelpsabit @JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had @JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY?? @JetBlue is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 😢 @JetBlue case making jackass out me we not allowed do favor say?get right care less!me no out of vacation now true see!am!peter scott @JetBlue False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice @JetBlue tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights. @jetblue rqstd upgrade to mint at LAX and was told no because i used points! Why turn down $1600 bcz I used points? #trueblue @jetblue trading customer experience for short term $$. So sad for this (previous?) loyal customer. https://t.co/dFmvmiBH4x @JetBlue flight 577  fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop @JetBlue Why wasn\\'t a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow? @JetBlue\\'s CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/h6cE3mWCqj @JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I\\'m actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now. @JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby? @JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today. @JetBlue Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago. @JetBlue Flight 1951. Bags haven\\'t come and we landed 30 minutes ago. @JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly @JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I\\'m good. @JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever @JetBlue If it was simply a minor mechanical, why would they say that? @JetBlue can you tweet #closepwcs to get the word out?😢 @JetBlue My mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if \"the passengers really knew what was going on\" and the attendant said no. @JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time. @JetBlue it says it is now 9:58 you owe me @JetBlue I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied @JetBlue They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago. @JetBlue 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th @JetBlue flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay. @JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo.

Carousel 6 signs not updating. @JetBlue I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it. #skytrax #jetblue #corpgreed #nevertakeno http://t.co/6MBVJFlpBM @JetBlue They did not have any &amp; asked if I wanted tea. How do you have tea&amp;not coffee? I\\'m a gold on United &amp; coffee I nvr think 2x about @JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed! @JetBlue I\\'d fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue @JetBlue the big board says we aren\\'t leaving until after 8:30 😩 @JetBlue while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option @JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of @AmericanAir shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out @JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don\\'t know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number. @JetBlue Whoa! No tag and you still saw my tweet. Flight 105 JFK to Chicago. Trying to get home to see my little brother wrestle! @JetBlue so why do you put this at the bottom of ur baggage report? For fun? #JetBlue @airlinequality #skytrax http://t.co/tU9JX2jaZN @JetBlue if u want to be helpful save me the trip from Westchester Cty to JFK, plus parking - my info is in the photo http://t.co/JI7xkS2jkk @JetBlue I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail @JetBlue u now have my gears grinding. The JFK baggage office told me I need to bring the bag back right now if not they will close my claim @JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn\\'t extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR @JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that\\'s the best answer u have? @JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can\\'t accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain @JetBlue PR-friendly tweets don\\'t help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note. @JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended! @JetBlue only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can\\'t just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason. @JetBlue keeps asking me to enter a valid email address. My info is saved and has worked hundreds of times before @JetBlue can\\'t change it. True blue points and I can\\'t get to a phone @JetBlue should\\'ve been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury @JetBlue I\\'m trying to add my 2012 flights to my Badges account but i don\\'t see an option. Help plz? @JetBlue I cheated on you, and I\\'m sorry. I\\'ll never do it again. @SouthwestAir has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever @JetBlue lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers @JetBlue what\\'s going on with 1171 LGA-FLL..poor to no communication from gate agents?? @JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers! @JetBlue our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3) @JetBlue insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3) @JetBlue Oh no! I thought it did. :( @JetBlue nope. None to be found @JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight. @JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here. @JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives? @JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me @JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can\\'t respond directly to me @JetBlue you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose. @JetBlue but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. For good reason. @JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers. @JetBlue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful @JetBlue Call was not made by the inflight crew. They in fact asked us why we didn\\'t bring it on. @JetBlue last week I bought a plane ticket round trip to FL &amp; just 4 fun I look at the price of them today and they went down! #nothappy @JetBlue Only middle seats. SFO -&gt; BOS. Not fun. She keeps getting $10 credits. Would much rather have a working TV. @JetBlue Disappointed we weren\\'t allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool. @JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn\\'t moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza @JetBlue Third flight in a row for my wife with her TV not working... @JetBlue what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about @JetBlue WHAT\\'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN\\'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO @JetBlue you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs? @JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn\\'t work agian!!and that\\'s the main reason I fly jetblue 😔😓😤 It\\'s on me, @JetBlue! That\\'s not what you said last night, though... :( @JetBlue @Cinnabon the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights!!!! #BonsInTheSky @JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR. @JetBlue spoken to 2 reps. Once I\\'m allowed to check my bag and through the TSA checkpoint, I guarantee I will be talking to someone. @JetBlue and the 20min line I stood in to drop my bag off? @JetBlue got txt  40min after sched dpt, saying plane had just arrived @ JFK. Late Flightr txt w/ dpt gate change. Then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight. @JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight. @JetBlue my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A. @JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue @JetBlue you stood me up last night, but I\\'m giving you a second chance. I\\'m just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home. @JetBlue waited for 15 min then got disconnect @JetBlue is I can\\'t make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone @JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess @JetBlue just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo @JetBlue @philpete wonder if that\\'s the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly? @JetBlue they say they have no update. I don\\'t work I don\\'t get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh! @JetBlue no news here at the gate. What are my options? @JetBlue well I\\'m glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I\\'d rather be (not) @JetBlue  no ... I am guessing I have to call someone @JetBlue why 730 and not 645 as scheduled? @JetBlue #1408 IAD to JFK still hasn\\'t boarded. What\\'s today\\'s excuse and how am I gonna get to work? @JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn\\'t work waiting for 10 min #nogood @JetBlue Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed. @JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable.. @JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things. @JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight. @JetBlue I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it @JetBlue disappointed that my flight back to boston from PR was Cancelled Flightled,rebooked 4 the next day,delayed that one too, and no compensation @JetBlue She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated. @JetBlue ripped my suitcase. I then was yelled at with attitude from Geraldine, your employee at the baggage center.Worst airline= #jetblue @JetBlue shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk @JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I\\'ll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting. @JetBlue the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service @JetBlue 6 hour delay. Supposed to land at 9pm now it\\'s 3am. Still not boarding. #EpicFail @JetBlue I hope your system wasn\\'t hacked cause someone else\\'s passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn\\'t get my boarding pass @JetBlue honestly I’m glad you didn’t Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I’ll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/ @JetBlue bag just delivered and items have been stolen.  At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum!  Wtf!! @JetBlue I\\'m disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song \"I\\'m Blue\" while flying on JetBlue. @JetBlue flight delayed 3x(!) and still not taking off on time, &amp; greeting me at my seat (yes it\\'s gum &amp; garbage): http://t.co/n9hmcrJChb @JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston @JetBlue I don\\'t know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that\\'s where we had all the changes to flights @JetBlue I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they\\'re busy but this is crazy @JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided! @JetBlue offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn\\'t go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp. @JetBlue right now completely pissed off @JetBlue I\\'ve had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat @JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity. @JetBlue dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me! @JetBlue now when I call it\\'s still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight @JetBlue they couldn\\'t do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8 @JetBlue flight from DCA to BOS has no heat #OhNo #BundleUp #Leastthebeverageswillbecold “@JetBlue: @Analystdoc Unfortunately that\\'s not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That\\'s a certain #fail Fix it plz. @JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number. @JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I\\'m entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued? @JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :( @JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks! @JetBlue well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats @JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves. @JetBlue that\\'s not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would\\'ve made the change earlier if given accurate info. @JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2 @JetBlue tell your employees that! @JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail @JetBlue ah yes. Put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips. #safetyfirst #sarcasm @JetBlue where exactly can I leave a note @JetBlue Guys, really bad @JetBlue #fail . Someone better call my wife back to get this handled. 203-382-3312 while she waits on hold.... @JetBlue #fail My wife on the phone asking to switch flight times. In mid switch gets disconnected. Now Cancelled Flightled! No new time! No call back @JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I\\'ll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official @JetBlue ticket issued whilst delivering your customers. @JetBlue understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I\\'ll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service. @JetBlue understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight? @JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday. @JetBlue so I\\'m penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat? @JetBlue dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75 @JetBlue the TV. Wifi was spotty. It\\'s just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won\\'t keep us away #lovejetblue @JetBlue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow\\'s flight? @JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional. @JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :( @JetBlue just lost my business   Enjoy your profits @JetBlue I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE @JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :( @JetBlue this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue @JetBlue insane the craziness I\\'ve seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue @JetBlue we are delayed, until he arrives @JetBlue @EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert @JetBlue whose performing at T5 @JetBlue flight 894, first officer not even at the airport wow!!!!!! Unreal, staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed. @JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success. @JetBlue yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can\\'t do online. Thanks. @JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can\\'t. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs @JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour @JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help @jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn\\'t explain delay. @JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage. @JetBlue tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on @JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then \"mailbox has not been set up yet.\" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C\\'mon @JetBlue \\nBut if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service. @JetBlue \\nApparently not. @JetBlue why are we delayed :( flight 1601 @JetBlue continue button generated a trip to \"plan your trip page\"\\nregardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems process\\nhint: the end of it @JetBlue remember - I\\'m very doubtful and not very hopeful :( @JetBlue I\\'ll give u a chance but I don\\'t think I\\'ll fall for it #backtodelta @JetBlue @KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it @JetBlue @KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn\\'t help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should @JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a @JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore! @JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight\\'s been delayed several times for my parents and i\\'m not receiving any alerts. @JetBlue hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane. @JetBlue just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing. Is Twitter an asset for Jet Blue now? @PhD_Mama_ @JetBlue, I normally ❤️ you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly @JetBlue @KyleJudah It doesn\\'t matter who you directed me to. It\\'s the principle of the matter. When I gate checked the stroller it was @JetBlue 117 days maybe. @JetBlue figured but delay is listed at almost 2 hrs. Thanks for being great! Cheers @JetBlue glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare. @JetBlue as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue @JetBlue Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol @JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection @JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I\\'ve spent almost $500 @JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting @JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC. @JetBlue should i continue? @JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact. @JetBlue Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect @JetBlue my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice @JetBlue busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether @JetBlue oh hell no. I\\'m not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people @JetBlue Is today\\'s JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it\\'s not... @JetBlue please provide me your direct email for me to explain. @JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation. @JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn\\'t be nicer @JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy @USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then. @USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak? @USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite @USAirways you\\'re killing me from the inside @USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents. @USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can\\'t resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail @USAirways always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn\\'t full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair @USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven\\'t boarded. @USAirways I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time. @USAirways Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable. @USAirways thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer @USAirways I cant get anyone on the phone to help with award travel.Purchased extra miles and 10 minutes Late Flightr the miles needed was raised. @USAirways Why haven\\'t you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow. @USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason. @USAirways thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet 😊 @USAirways I have two tight connections in #Charlotte and #Frankfurt @USAirways Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr! @USAirways ur \"response\" was: my \"inconvenience was of no matter.\" U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair @USAirways Sadly I\\'m currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can. @USAirways standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days. @USAirways Why can\\'t I check in online for a flight tomorrow am? @USAirways - been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS! @USAirways after being assured by the pleasant woman at gate B11 in Albany, NY that life\\'s not perfect, I\\'d heard enough. @USAirways: u didn\\'t bother following up, we booked with @Delta.  @Delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats! @USAirways There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I\\'m not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info? @USAirways @AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround @USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn\\'t do anything another said she didn\\'t know why the first person we talked 2 said that @USAirways @AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far @usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what\\'s next?? #USAIR #nothappy @USAirways I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. http://t.co/cHGy5yrVka @USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on. @USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven\\'t spoke to a human. Never using you again. @USAirways You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I\\'ll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again. @USAirways how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours?  Should I be super platinum diamond status @USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I\\'ve Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you. .@USAirways It was this saturday during all the snow in the DC area.  Excited the flight was not Cancelled Flightled but sad he went missing. @USAirways @AmericanAir I love you guys &amp; I\\'m gonna let you finish, but I\\'ve been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher. @USAirways And, the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail @USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found. @USAirways I don\\'t want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag @USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren\\'t medical equipment and that she should have \"planned better.\" @USAirways - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A @USAirways - First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!! @USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren\\'t for a family emergency, I\\'d Cancelled Flight. @USAirways ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United @USAirways sadly that didn\\'t help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!! .@USAirways I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home. @USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped @USAirways 167 minutes?  \"Im not trained in that\". Cmon. Can\\'t you do better than that? @USAirways any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on @USAirways trying to use chairman upgrade cert for flt 740 on 2/26/14 but being told not an option with 10 open seats? How? Thanks @USAirways but I\\'ve been trying to call them since yesterday and I keep getting hung up on? Can you get me through to them?? @USAirways an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it @usairways Ok thank you…I call from Spain to US for seating assistance! @USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate. @USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP @USAirways still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match @Delta? @USAirways has the worst customer service. Can\\'t even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me @USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing. @USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002 @usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt @USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time! @USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn\\'t arrive @USAirways like they will call me? I\\'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering... @USAirways your CSR in PHL suck.   Flt 3883 gets cx\\'d,  i get rebooked to the next day?  On standby for 4011. Not hopeful. @USAirways HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice @USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won\\'t be able to buy one unless I speak to someone! @USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS @USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection. @USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your \"go to\" maneuver? @USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable. @USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full @USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50. @USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online.... @USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU @USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to \"bad weather\" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone? @USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says \"due to weather….call back Late Flightr\"  #outofbusiness ? @USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you. @USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating! @USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out. @USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service. @USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don\\'t have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek @USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn\\'t fix the problem @USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I\\'m flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC??? @USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn\\'t been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst @USAirways been trying for weeks no use @USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess @USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE. @USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets @USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I\\'ve spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours? @USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature! @USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q\\'d to take off. And we checked our bags. @USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please. @USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers. @USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever. @USAirways why aren\\'t you updating flight status/delays? @USAirways They\\'re also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you\\'re not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out @USAirways nope, they just announced we\\'re headed back to the gate. @USAirways pretty sure we didn\\'t actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu @USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I\\'ve wasted. I\\'ve got a job &amp; family this is crazy @USAirways 5203 and we\\'re just sitting 20 feet from an open gate @USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online @USAirways what\\'s wrong with the plane? Flt 581 @USAirways @united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I\\'m stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. 👍 @USAirways @AmericanAir Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd http://t.co/MbLTALr4BS STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am @USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head @USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, \"because I told you to!\" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable! @USAirways , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question @USAirways nah it\\'s for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven\\'t released the last open First seat to me @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation. @USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail @USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don\\'t have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service @USAirways nope not yet... @usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours. @usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I\\'m supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic @usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought. @usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn\\'t have done it without you. @USAirways it\\'s not like I\\'m trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don\\'t want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU. @USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They\\'re flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $. @USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer. @USAirways it doesn\\'t take 6 days to respond to an already open case! @USAirways are people going to answer our calls? @USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail @USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We\\'ll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail @USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn\\'t schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail @USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost @USAirways I don\\'t like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I\\'ve been stuck in CA all day and should\\'ve been home by now. You owe me. @USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am. @USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH @USAirways can\\'t get back lost time @USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired @USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution? @USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don\\'t have it? Flight 719 2/22/14 @USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can\\'t go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1 @USAirways Hi. I\\'m in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare? @USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death. @USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor\\'s note. @USAirways  I\\'ve never been treated this badly @USAirways  I\\'m glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems. @USAirways  Three months and my miles haven\\'t been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent. @USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It\\'s been three months and my miles @USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail @USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open\\n-- My request to merge the accounts is denied @USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don\\'t want this blasting here. @USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont\\' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles @USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card @USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I\\'d forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I @usairways - It\\'s all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I\\'m having @USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn\\'t let me on the plane because we were (1/4) @USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo @USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold @USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly. @USAirways I\\'ve flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words. @USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel @USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help. @USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I\\'ve been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else. @USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can\\'t get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update?? @USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said! @USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it\\'s 11:30pm #NoExcuses @USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn\\'t get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens. @USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don\\'t have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn\\'t nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings @USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they\\'ll Cancelled Flight my whole flight. @USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed @USAirways terrible service @USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person, @USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I\\'m a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues! @USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account. @USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person. @USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.\\n#socialtantrum @USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren\\'t anymore for tonight...not fun :-/ @USAirways Well, that\\'s a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do? @USAirways it is my fault but i bought online and i get twice why i buy twice it fault but i bougth ticket jfk to mccaren and usairways ++ @usairways  US1799 CLT-&gt;SFO in first no desert, no snack basket. Incoming was on time ? What’s up? @USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I\\'d seen was gone.  Had to get supv. @USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I\\'m officially done flying with you. @USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I\\'ve called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being. @usairways that wasn\\'t the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won\\'t let me process my request. SMH @USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this. @USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you. @USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund @USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL @USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but @USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks. @USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat @USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable. @USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing! @USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak @USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation? @USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma\\'s watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :) @USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I\\'ve fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today @usairways I\\'ve been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren\\'t showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth @USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold. @USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back @USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it\\'s no wonder you had to sell @USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow. @USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time. @USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo @USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys. @USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE @USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously? @USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow. @USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers @USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain @USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola. @USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening @USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never. @USAirways I can\\'t wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best @USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways. @USAirways It\\'s very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don\\'t answer the phone @USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help @USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645 @USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn\\'t departed. Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options. @USAirways should, but didn’t. @USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again @USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible @USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip @USAirways what\\'s up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service. @USAirways very embarrassing. @USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler. @USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this? @USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs @USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight. @USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD @USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them. @USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits... @USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4 @USAirways  has me on my toes whether I\\'m going to make my flight back to Boston tonight @USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude @USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight. @USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold? @USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened. @USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening \"in front\" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing @USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can\\'t get a response after a week. Unacceptable @USAirways  I will never fly us airways again. @USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays @USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don\\'t have enough hours together. Fail @USAirways yes, thanks but took forever @USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news! @USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn\\'t get on the 4:05 @USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not? @USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination. @USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with. @USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice. .@USAirways Have you just given up? .@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME. @USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA) @USAirways Your \"moveup\" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am... @USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app? @USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways @USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service @USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me @USAirways @hhagerty that\\'s a lie. @USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews @USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me. @USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls! @USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat @USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time. @USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously @USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help! @USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me. @USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded. @USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten @USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane @USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH? @USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day. @USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP @USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn\\'t offered.  Awful service continues. @USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines. @USAirways I checked in \"Standby for 1st Class\" only to find I am \"not on the list\". This merger is a pain. @USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous @USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now. @USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600????? @USAirways only happened because u couldn\\'t get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags @USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again @USAirways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road @USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock. @USAirways power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was @USAirways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on. @USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me. @USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them @USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable. @USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I\\'m so upset @USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday. @USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright @USAirways the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c @USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off @USAirways what happens if it isn\\'t located @USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me @USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time @USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight @USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don\\'t like being told how lousy your service is. @USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before. @USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx. @USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople @USAirways I have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while Flight Booking Problems. Pls help @USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down! @USAirways just an FYI I\\'ll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got. @USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly. @USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I\\'m sure TSA would. @USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don\\'t. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready @USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short @USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down. @USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today. @USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever @USAirways Don\\'t blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility @USAirways too Late Flight. @USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that\\'s true I never want to fly US Airways again @USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that? @usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr. @USAirways you guys lost my luggage @USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr. @USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances. @USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn\\'t get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen! @USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable @USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x @USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet\\'s smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment. @USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet\\'s smallest water bottles. @USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us. @USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get \"MEL\" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone? @USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all @USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment. @USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard. @USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we\\'re not hearing from pilot for long periods. @USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I\\'ve ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq @USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won\\'t be any good publicity... @USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange. @USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing @USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic \"sorry\" email back @USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules. @USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn\\'t help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK @USAirways So you understand why I\\'m resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward. @USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please! @USAirways, I\\'m expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box. @USAirways what\\'s the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac? @USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy @usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx. @USAirways well that is not going to help. I\\'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he\\'s elite wAA @usairways hi. You lost my father\\'s wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me. @USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go. @USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them. @USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on. @usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you\\'re looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need. @USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground! @USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers. @USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn\\'t know when we\\'ll leave. @USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold... @USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest. @USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX. @USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given. @USAirways flights &amp; \"customer relations\" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE @USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents! @USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry @USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm. @USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information. @USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA. @USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time. @USAirways usually \"sorry\" doesn\\'t involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that\\'s a club perk. @USAirways don\\'t worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me @USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits @USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight @USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service @USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways @USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn\\'t work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody... @USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed. @USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!! @USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered? @USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold @USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online? @USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail @USAirways how long for a reply @USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways @USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I\\'ve called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up @USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I\\'ve been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days @USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane .@USAirways Can\\'t book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help? @USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I\\'ve ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time @USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me? @USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn\\'t book a flight via calling either :( @USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077 @USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever. @USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best! @USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person... @USAirways Your system is affected by the weather? @USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating @USAirways I\\'m unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven\\'t heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates?? @USAirways / @AmericanAir don\\'t forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail @USAirways @AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare} @USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We\\'ll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail @USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning. @USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost @USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail @USAirways what\\'s going on with your website &amp; mobile app??? Help!!! @USAirways We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response! @USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced. @USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on @USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail @USAirways I\\'m sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times @USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it\\'s not even over yet #stepitup @USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls @USAirways no you call me. @USAirways they told me to call back Late Flightr @USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week. @USAirways I cant make it to airport, roads are to bad in DFW and no one is answering the phones and the website is down?How do I reschedule @USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr @USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there @USAirways rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip. @USAirways If my flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled every week I might as well be in business class. @USAirways 2102 DCA-BOS. Cancelled Flightled after making us wait over an hour. If I fly USAir every week can you upgrade my status proactively? @USAirways congrats on treating your customers the worst way possible. I know plenty of other ppl who have had horrible experience w you too @USAirways Going to Manchester, UK now i\\'m going to miss a wedding. You going to rebook that too? Why have you chosen to Cancelled Flight my flight?? @USAirways if you DM me we can take this offline. Would love more info on location of lost bags. Any help is appreciated. @USAirways thanx but this isn\\'t my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed. @USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com @USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I\\'m staring at empty overhead room. @USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you\\'re gonna keep us siting here forever? @USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me. @USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update. @USAirways but my bag is still missing @USAirways Seriously doubt that as I am still sitting inside at the gate. @USAirways Customer service is dead.

Now missing required training. Not a happy customer. @USAirways Strike Three!!! You guys suck!!! @USAirways 2 days in a row, not buying it. I suggest you review your policy w respect to unaccompanied minors, should have had a seat on Sun @USAirways @AmericanAir ok the app doesn\\'t seem to be working. just use the mobile site... http://t.co/4kLfywwMq1 @USAirways Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn\\'t get dividend miles credited. @USAirways 8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge.  You treat your customers like crap @USAirways @AmericanAir 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request @USAirways @AmericanAir 3 hours on hold got rebooked on a new flight yesterday.

I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks! @USAirways @AmericanAir \"ma\\'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure\" \"but I was here 20 mins before?!?\" laughter from the 2 agents @USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: \"why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?\" @USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can\\'t get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use! @USAirways @AmericanAir me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents @USAirways I need to speak with a live person. I\\'ve had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we\\'d have our luggage by yest. @USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast @USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles. @USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this. @USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it\\'s maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable. @USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly @USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.. @USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning. @USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date @USAirways i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now.... @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable @USAirways Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - @americanairlnes finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM @USAirways I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids @USAirways Will tweet all day until I get \\na live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don\\'t care about your customers health. @USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again. @USAirways @AmericanAir on hold for 8 hours yesterday w/o speaking to an agent on hold again w/ 2 phones ~30 mins let the bashing begin... @USAirways please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!! @USAirways I will. Is it down or is just me? @USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight @USAirways: I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience. @USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me. @USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; \"Anthony\" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they\\'re weighing you down. @USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to \"ground handling delays affecting a prior flight.\" @USAirways : When You\\'ve Got to Get There, We\\'ve Got Excuses! #usairwaysfail @USAirways first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me! @USAirways sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown http://t.co/Pw1eudlcZg @USAirways : We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail @USAirways Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn\\'t help.

This is ridiculous. I shouldn\\'t have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf @usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome @USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you\\'re attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail @USAirways hello??? Anyone there? @USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed @USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA \\'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out\\' Airline @USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy @USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!! @USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help @USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else @USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise @USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren\\'t here 45 minutes Late Flightr @USAirways. wow, awful customer service. @USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it. @USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls? @USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you. @USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!? @USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait. @USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again. @USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me. @USAirways I\\'ve flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways @USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒 @USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable @USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore? @USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :) @USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature. @USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR??? @USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN @USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help? @USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems? @USAirways Please don\\'t trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience @USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long? @USAirways sorry doesn\\'t help.  It\\'s midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line? @USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia? @USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly. @USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I\\'m flying southwest and her blue from now on. @USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight. @USAirways there\\'s over 50 people in line and only one agent! @USAirways And by the way, I\\'m planning it while I\\'ve Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour! @USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area. @USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways. @USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me! @USAirways you guys are the worst airline I\\'ve ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service @USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST! @USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with. @USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled. @USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don\\'t care????!!! @USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep? @USAirways who\\'s in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight @USAirways the call hung up on me.. @USAirways got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! http://t.co/5cDX2ROAE6 @USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!! @USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler @USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL Number or email? That\\'s the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways @USAirways it still says that I can\\'t check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly @USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn\\'t left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline @USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights. @USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh @USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job? @USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡 @USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg @USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir @USAirways ....

After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one @USAirways give us no information and an attitude. @USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us @USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no... @USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours. @USAirways @AmericanAir have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees.

Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am? @USAirways any update on this flight?It\\'s more than three hours delayed. Thank you. @USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly @USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight???????? @USAirways - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards @USAirways nightmare trying to get to Costa Rica from PHL today.

Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted @USAirways Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR.

You lie so you\\'re not at fault @USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS @USAirways no more hotel voucher?

I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief. @USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn\\'t fast enough @USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to \"go left\" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there @USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami. @USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip @USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours. @USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn\\'t even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed @USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn\\'t allow to make change online? @USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity @USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it\\'ll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible. @USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won\\'t go-HELP!!! @USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough @USAirways fuck you. @USAirways I\\'m dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever @USAirways How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst @USAirways worst customer service I\\'ve ever experienced. I\\'ll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you. @USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN @USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ? @usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather? @USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks @USAirways Website won\\'t let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help. @USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service? @USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help! @USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren\\'t getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason. @USAirways literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot @usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP? @USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke @USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help @USAirways transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help! @USAirways flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction @USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That\\'s pretty awesome if you ask me... @USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family @USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn\\'t help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing. @USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there? @USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales @USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands... @USAirways US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I\\'ve never been booked twice @USAirways Already tried. How about Conf # via DM @USAirways new slogan should be \"if you don\\'t want to arrive on time, pick us\" @USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail @USAirways they weren\\'t able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine @USAirways I will send an email with details Late Flightr. Thank you for responding. @USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that! @USAirways @AmericanAir did I mention I\\'m a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher? @usairways Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp? @USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I\\'m now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow @USAirways @AmericanAir I\\'m stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID @USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed @USAirways @AmericanAir u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside @USAirways Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg @USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent. @USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad @USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don\\'t have a reservation...Explain @USAirways @AmericanAir thought u merged but #USAirways sucks #worstever http://t.co/myNZitCovn @USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold @USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together. @USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn\\'t customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it\\'s brutal! @USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It\\'s just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys @USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory @USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out. @USAirways them and @AmericanAir @USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows @USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing. @USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle. @USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don\\'t have seats. Never flying @usairways again @USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain @USAirways it\\'s not misjudging it\\'s a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers @USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week. @USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy @USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks @USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company. @USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn\\'t even until June. @USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered @USAirways yep, check it and my gmail \\'Promotions\\' folder regularly... :-( @USAirways thanks for nothing @USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let\\'s hope this plane works. I\\'m tired. @USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the \\'missing\\' emails. @usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight? @usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue @USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. \"Please wait\" then same form. @USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times. @USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I\\'m appalled. @USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone. @USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life @USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout @USAirways @AmericanAir can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip Is it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a \"non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip @USAirways there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn\\'t posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen? @USAirways I\\'m trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can\\'t my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number. @USAirways flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn\\'t seem to be anyone\\'s concern. @USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed @USAirways link didn\\'t work via Mobil. @USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up. @USAirways How do I get through? @USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck @USAirways why I can\\'t book a flight to PRN through your website? @USAirways this is ridiculous #planebroken can\\'t wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab @USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I\\'m confused since we had sunny skies @USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW! @USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay? @USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing. @USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX @USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate. @USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel @nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways @USAirways it\\'s painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA @usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail @USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm. @USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What\\'s the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer. @USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed! @USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail @USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed @USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer. @USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door! @USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what? @USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I\\'m stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed. @USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU @USAirways I\\'ve tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME @USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans. @USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it\\'s \"not worth it\" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS @USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this \"service\" is acceptable. #customerservicefail “@USAirways: We\\'re sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone\\'s call and we appreciate your patience.” #false @USAirways It wasn\\'t weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :( @USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you! @USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers @USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don\\'t care how many points he has! He only has @USAirways we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right? @USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim! @USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking @USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me? @USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service @USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service. @USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices? @USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don\\'t match even though I can\\'t find a difference. @USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service @USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag. @USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice @USAirways I\\'m glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available. @USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don\\'t make it easy for the customer to access it. @USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days @USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up @USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won\\'t have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail @USAirways Literally all that says is \"Case open\"  What good is that to me? @USAirways no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights @USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect @sarahpompei don\\'t bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice @USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure. @USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines. @USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back @USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I\\'ve since learned @Delta had one! @USAirways delayed I\\'m charlotte big surprise @USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could\\'ve handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA @AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight @USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS! @nrhodes85 isn\\'t it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn\\'t actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed @USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I\\'ll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA. @USAirways We\\'ve been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn\\'t that have been done b4 we got on???? @USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx @USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps. @USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage! @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what\\'s wrong?!? @USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don\\'t treat me like its no big deal! @USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares? @USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707? @USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter @USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI! @USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it\\'s not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what\\'s happening, arrangements can be made @USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I\\'m so displeased. @USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more). @USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back # @USAirways the flights weren\\'t from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday @USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster @USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I\\'m a platinum member with AA and feel like it\\'s worthless @USAirways never let\\'s me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed. @USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection @USAirways I\\'ve been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5 @USAirways Thanks, but you can\\'t. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for \"maintenance\" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me. @USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing @USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route. @USAirways 835, fix this ASAP @USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated.\" @USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?! @USAirways I\\'m logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it @USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal. @USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2 @USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn\\'t help. This is terrible. @USAirways what is the damn delay???? @USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here @usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can\\'t do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless. @USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday! @USAirways And also, it\\'s great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless. .@USAirways You\\'ll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again. @Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing! @Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there\\'s a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours! @USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service @USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate @USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout @USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay for Choice @USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on. @USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable @USAirways doesn\\'t seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn\\'t help #usairwaysfail @USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous @USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight. @USAirways the plane is moving and it\\'s no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open. @USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay. @USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half. @USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight. @USAirways this is so unacceptable. I\\'m going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air @USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn\\'t even let us off. @USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days @USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH @USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that???? @USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we\\'re an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today. @USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class. @USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard @USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off @USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O\\'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else @USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We\\'ve heard it all! #LetsGo @USAirways \"Able\"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won\\'t fit overhead? @USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue. @USAirways is the worst!! Still haven\\'t left.. Everyone missing connections. @USAirways today\\'s flight to Philadelphia.  It\\'s a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it\\'s not even snowing in FL. @USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven\\'t talked to a human. @USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston @USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!! @USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight. @USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni .@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm. @USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more! @USAirways this response doesn\\'t correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated @USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience! @USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical. @USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service. @USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn\\'t be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time. @USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven\\'t left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad @USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience. @USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes @USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable. @USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!! @USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA @USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us @USAirways that\\'s incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice @USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to \"choose\" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors @USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/ @USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks @USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better. @USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles? @USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I\\'m STRANDED!! @USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice. @USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket? @USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up? @USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary. @USAirways doesn\\'t want me to get home @USAirways They don\\'t stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway? @USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour! @USAirways - I bet you don\\'t, but I\\'m the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you. @USAirways I can\\'t even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket. @USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful @USAirways that\\'s the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge. @USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays. @USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta @USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help! @USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857. @USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won\\'t be that difficult am sure #disappointed @USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don\\'t know gate is occupied and keep us waiting @USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment. @USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs @USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I\\'ve come to expect. @USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer\\'s money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused. @USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people\\'s memories! You should be ashamed! @USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service?? @USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help! @USAirways we can\\'t afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can\\'t afford to go home. @USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded. @USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa @USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives??? @USAirways I already HAVE, four times @USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you\\'re understaffed. @USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do? @USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer @USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn\\'t eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS @USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF @USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn\\'t need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway @USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can\\'t think@of even ONE. @USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie @USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways @USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost @USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It\\'s been 6 days. @USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ @USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight @USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!! @USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave! @USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked \"completed\". I\\'m scared I\\'m going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded. @USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that\\'s the case then why does it still say \"in progress\" on Paypal\\'s website. I reserved on the 13th. @USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight\\'s delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :) @USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE @USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status. @USAirways never fails to disappoint. @USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can\\'t I check in for flight tomorrow? @UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500. @USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now @USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!! @USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether @USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn\\'t just be throwing them on the cart. @USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues @USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame.. @USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today @USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers @USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight? @USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything. @USAirways 4420 delayed further? @USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there. .@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full. @USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡 @USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member. @USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something @USAirways please secure the \\'footrest\\' shelf\\' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ @USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay. @USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew! @USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND @USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don\\'t create policy. But it\\'s an undue penalty for a job req\\'ing flexibility @USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps @USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS. @USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I\\'ll keep you posted @USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend\\'s wedding! #strandedattheairport @USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :( @USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more @USAirways I\\'m not patient. I\\'m annoyed. If you can\\'t book this travel online, then you shouldn\\'t make people wait on the phone. @USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please “@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt @USAirways still waiting on a response @USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can\\'t be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website. @USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers @USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat @USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can\\'t sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed. @USAirways but you guys switched me and didn\\'t inform me of the chathes @USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice @USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad. @USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning. @USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it @USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting @USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home. @USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible @USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will. @USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService @USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn\\'t have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight. @USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven\\'t changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane. @USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene\\'s not honored @USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy. @USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its @USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y\\'all merged? @USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times... @USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable. @USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter @USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck! @USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative @USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA @USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!! @USAirways what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797 @USAirways Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to \"maintenance\". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting. @USAirways I\\'ll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :( @USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You\\'re an inferior airline. @USAirways I\\'ve called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP. @USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn\\'t help me at all. @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful @USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled. @USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god. @USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can\\'t change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience @USAirways I\\'ve been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP? @USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue? @USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often... @usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that\\'d be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings. @USAirways what\\'s the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight? @USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated @USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours @USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started @USAirways what\\'s happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication! @USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on. @USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags! @USAirways 😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour. @USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection. @USAirways of course! \"Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch\" it\\'s not the fact, it\\'s the attitude! @USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone. @USAirways found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min @USAirways we on on the flight from phf to clt. At the terminal but can\\'t get off plane yet. Need to get on iah flight. @USAirways can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time @USAirways @AmericanAir I\\'m a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st. @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it\\'s time to higher more staff! @USAirways yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours i wish i was flying @USAirways ... @JetBlue Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff @USAirways 502 M-phx Im still on The plane waiting And waiting @USAirways I\\'m trying to merge my freq flyer accts but keep getting an error message and only a machine when calling the # provided. Help! @USAirways our hold up now is the captain that was Late Flight...his bag doesn\\'t fit. @USAirways that\\'s it?!?!? @USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue? @USAirways My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled \"do no occupy\" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable @USAirways phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it! @USAirways let\\'s say it\\'s directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less! @USAirways I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt @USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883) @USAirways I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash. @USAirways on flight # 556 delayed#connection help for flight # 561 # help via email @usairways hey just letting you know you\\'re the worst fucking service I\\'ve ever used thanks for nothing @USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her.

Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 \\'s 40th #GTH239 @USAirways i hate you @USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable @USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem @USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat @USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy @USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff @USAirways the gate agent said \"it\\'s booked in full. Sorry\" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land. @USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can\\'t move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again! @USAirways you\\'re the only airline that\\'s not open sooner. It\\'s not a confidence booster. @USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen? @USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can\\'t get through TSA @USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating. @USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service @USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am @USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.. @USAirways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day @USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself @USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn\\'t have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help @USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV @USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways @USAirways I didn\\'t Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags @USAirways : i was told my ticket expired but  i never recvd any notice  before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt @USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail @USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min @USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles? @USAirways I didn\\'t take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn\\'t get in til 5 @USAirways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight. @USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd. @USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported. @USAirways lost our luggage. #yay @USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?! @USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation @USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help @USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back @USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her @USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess @USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don\\'t know where my bags are, won\\'t refund me my flight?!?! It wasn\\'t weather!! @USAirways no your not! @USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled @USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing @USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8 @USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I\\'m dumb and should be using a different airline #wth @USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it\\'s middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient. @USAirways delays to the max @USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA @USAirways it shouldn\\'t take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far @USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected. @USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing... @USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help! @USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE @USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he\\'s called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr @USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa. @USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done @USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can\\'t find my bag anywhere bc they\\'re saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX. @USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we\\'re already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr @USAirways being told \\'tough break and this is how it is\\' is unacceptable. You can\\'t even tell me when my bags will be here @USAirways now telling me I don\\'t have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!! @USAirways Your software is broken. \"Call Customer Support\" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers. @USAirways It\\'s not double booked. I spoke with CS and we\\'ve got a plan to fix this. It\\'s still an amateur mistake that should never happen. @USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit? @USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone @USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I\\'ll probably be taking my business elsewhere. @USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa. @USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight? @USAirways so far I\\'ve gotten six different answers @USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double. @USAirways what\\'s going on? I\\'ve been hearing a not-friendly \\'Please wait\\' on repeat while I\\'m on hold, being transferred to idk where... @USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That\\'s not good. @USAirways I\\'m sorry as well. It\\'s been 24 hrs without my bag and I can\\'t get a straight answers. I\\'m on call #6 for today. @USAirways Ya\\'ll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs. @USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there\\'s a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we\\'ll be taking off. @USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn\\'t be stuck in horrible CLT now. @USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA “@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code? @USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier @USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us? @USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting. @USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I\\'ve tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :( @USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member. @USAirways I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly. @USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL @USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks @USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That\\'s so wrong @USAirways. I\\'m delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good @USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool @USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle\\'s funeral, and you \"hope\" they can find another flight. That\\'s very considerate of you. @USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I\\'m very disappointed. @USAirways just lost a faithful customer. @USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out @usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don\\'t lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v @USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided. @USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys @USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks @USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn\\'t ready @USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic @USAirways that\\'s understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate @USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is! @USAirways Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC. @USAirways your app sucks balls compared to @AmericanAir @USAirways #USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR @USAirways \"admirals club\" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!! @USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile @USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account. @USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew? @USAirways my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485 @USAirways no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response?????? @USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck @USAirways us2118\\nMy wife in Boston says no snow right now. @USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don\\'t care @USAirways you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks @USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it\\'s not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218 @USAirways I\\'ve been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering. @USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again... @USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them @USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks @USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard @USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville @USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst @USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again @USAirways What\\'s the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don\\'t scan it  for tracking? @USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease @USAirways you can\\'t even track my bag to see where it is. It\\'s like it\\'s disappeared. @USAirways Can\\'t get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It\\'s been over a month since travel &amp; I\\'ve submitted twice online @USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !! @USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I\\'ve called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person. @USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight @USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend @USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service @USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage @USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off. @USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport @USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do? @USAirways so mad I can\\'t even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher @USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I\\'d like an answer. @USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges @USAirways I\\'ve done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don\\'t understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting. @USAirways that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0 @USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn\\'t be more unhelpful. Why Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn\\'t see my father be4 they put him in a coma @USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa @USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks @USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks @USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn\\'t get home until midnight. #NeverAgain @USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone. @USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold? @usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation? @usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire @usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold? @USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all. @USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply\\'s #usairwaysssuck @USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is \"I don\\'t really know what happened\" @USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks @USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks @scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we\\'re not sure what a timbit is...) @USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!! @USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase. @USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again? @USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone? @USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible @USAirways that\\'s ok, just know that I\\'ll most likely never book with you again @USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck @USAirways I don\\'t mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn\\'t have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food! @usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks. @USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process? @USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway @usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options @USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I\\'ll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week @USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through. @USAirways \\nAre you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in \\'y\\'? @USAirways There isn\\'t a ticket number...the transaction is still pending. @USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us... @USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41. @USAirways your agent did not say @USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho @USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy? @USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request @USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself @USAirways that link is broken. But if it\\'s the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information. @USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I\\'m still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up @USAirways stranded in Philly- #Starving and can\\'t get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue /  next flight in 10 hrs @USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting @USAirways link doesn\\'t work and I\\'ve tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn\\'t clarify where it is. @USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there\\'s only 2. Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways . @USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection? @USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove @USAirways this is crazy. Haven\\'t spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD @USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance! @USAirways I\\'ve been trying for DAYS!  And I don\\'t get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do?? @USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I\\'m just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed. @USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can\\'t even fix it. Worst service I\\'ve ever had @USAirways I\\'ve been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help! @USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies. @USAirways where\\'s my apology? @USAirways Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn\\'t talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg. @USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help? @USAirways new tag line \"but we got you there alive!\" @USAirways 2 days in a row I call and still can\\'t get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees? @USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$? @USAirways Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight. @USAirways flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke @USAirways So we got her home, now we just need her bag. Is there a direct desk number for Savannah? @USAirways I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren\\'t sure what city my bag was in. @USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a \"sorry for your inconvenience\" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed @USAirways @AmericanAir 90 min delay thanks to \"maintenance issues\". Thanks for wasting a day. @USAirways \\nNot one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ⤵ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy @USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways @USAirways Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn\\'t go @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that\\'s after being hung up on the first time. @USAirways is useless airways.

No thanks @USAirways will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice @USAirways any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour @USAirways little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete. @USAirways we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren\\'t the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease @USAirways still can\\'t get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes @USAirways has an SPF record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. DNS admin needs to fix! @USAirways so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/HAJ5lKqjW4 ,@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I\\'m not patient. I have no choice.  #Antitrust issue @USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone! @USAirways Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I\\'ve missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations. @USAirways I don\\'t need to rebook I need to know the policy @USAirways No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can\\'t afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit. @USAirways we\\'re all standing here and no one is saying anything. I\\'ll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv @USAirways that is the most useless tweet I\\'ve ever seen out of you. @USAirways this is got to be the worst service I\\'ve ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed @USAirways so you\\'re going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that\\'s part of the problem @USAirways now over 2 hrs. Can\\'t wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways http://t.co/BuwjTVUWKM @usairways I\\'ve called for 3 days and can\\'t get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn\\'t result in you hanging up on me? @USAirways what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed? @USAirways why aren\\'t twitter and reservations connected?

Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved @USAirways gate agents are now working with everyone to resolve connecting flight issues which is my concern @USAirways 5534. That\\'s the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled.  Now 5534 is on 1hr delay @USAirways, 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one.  &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn\\'t mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious. @USAirways  please don\\'t go to the check in process @AmericanAir uses at #MCO. It\\'s an absolute disaster. @USAirways how about a phone # to talk to a real person? @USAirways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us @USAirways I gave up http://t.co/2eDgc6TbLs @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way? @USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess @USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do @USAirways after last night in Charlotte NC I\\'m seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves. @USAirways great but that still does not help me.. @USAirways @Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go @USAirways why didn\\'t you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose @USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls @USAirways my luggage was delayed. I\\'m looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it... @USAirways @AmericanAir stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness @USAirways Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways Thanks. “@USAirways: @fispahani Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We\\'re sorry for the delay to your flight.” @USAirways 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09keJ9bv1 @USAirways Fuck you @USAirways not even on your dime and free tickets.  #worsttraveldayever @USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening. @USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons. @USAirways 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkAxUNYfn2 @USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now! @usairways traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover. @usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail @USAirways of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I\\'ll choose wiser next time @USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue. @USAirways half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming @USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number. @USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers. @USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again @USAirways that link leads to a website that won\\'t open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding. @USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I\\'d be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact? @USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I\\'ve landed but was suppose to land at 5 @USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn\\'t make up for it @USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She\\'s only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 👿 @USAirways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them @USAirways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home 👠👠👠 (3 heel clicks) @USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don\\'t have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening? @USAirways I\\'m sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether @USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour @USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her @USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful. @USAirways hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board @USAirways a flight update doesn\\'t help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑 @USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..??? @USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious @USAirways I\\'m sure you don\\'t but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won\\'t come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks. @USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow @USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA @USAirways @noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail @USAirways Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP @USAirways on hold for 1:23. All because they won\\'t let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA @USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword @USAirways No, they won\\'t because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn\\'t borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours... @USAirways I\\'ve been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain @USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all @USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways @USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice @USAirways car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications @USAirways I\\'m amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers. @USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn\\'t care less @USAirways beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English). @USAirways they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy. @USAirways bad weather shouldn\\'t mean bad service @USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff. @USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever. @USAirways what does \"your reservation is \\'out of sync.\\'\" mean?

I need that bag! @USAirways flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do? @USAirways I\\'m on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight. @USAirways is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today. @USAirways Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I\\'ve ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee @USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true? @USAirways I did, but it won\\'t help.. Can\\'t believe you wouldn\\'t take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits? @USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous! @USAirways been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down. @USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It\\'s like this is a joke to you. thanks to @USAirways my trip is all screwed up.

Their media team appreciates the updates 😎 @USAirways flight 4524  first a 2 hour wait for a deadhead crew  then deadhead crew takes overhead bin space paying customers annoyed @USAirways And really, it\\'s a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues. @USAirways very disappointed I wasn\\'t \"allowed\" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning. @USAirways They\\'re all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult. @USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I\\'ll put it on blast on social media and TV @USAirways yes I can pay out of pocket that us not helping me for loosing my first class ticket to coach.

No employees to load bags? #terrible @USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for. @USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That\\'s unacceptable. I\\'m willing to wait on hold, but that\\'s not an option. @USAirways I\\'ve been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help. @usairways It was 9º, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :| @USAirways I\\'m traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good. @USAirways I don\\'t know I\\'ve tried to call for confirmation but calls aren\\'t going thru. Can you let me know? @USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled? @USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par. @USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw. @USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better @USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers @USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta... @USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now @USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain @USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn\\'t absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight @usairways I’m cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck @usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough! @USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn\\'t your fault, but your response to it couldn\\'t have been worse. @USAirways any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;( @usairways Yes. Works in Firefox. \\n\\nCan do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now. @USAirways 2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills. @USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight @usairways told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins. @USAirways And it\\'s 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update? @USAirways still can\\'t get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks @USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn\\'t exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn @usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway—why not just put thru baggage claim? @USAirways @AmericanAir  we are on us/aa flight 4443.We  arrived at dca at 2:12. Waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. No update? @USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours @USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part... @USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn\\'t help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service @USAirways your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks @USAirways we\\'ve (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate.

Two just left their desks completely (1/2) @USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn\\'t work either. What is your customer service phone number? @USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense? @USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC? @USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email. @USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed @usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn\\'t use the internet to make a reservation.\\n\\nSite won\\'t work on Chrome, on several computers. @USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923.

And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow. @AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that? @AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff @AmericanAir I\\'m not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place. @AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks! @AmericanAir that doesn\\'t really answer my question.

Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response. @AmericanAir Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW... @DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help! @DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don\\'t follow me @AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless @AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me.

Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help. @AmericanAir “Inconvenient” is such a convenient word. @AmericanAir\\n Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag. @AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful @AmericanAir That\\'s ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this. @AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can\\'t miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed @AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm @AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you\\'re not following me and I can\\'t. @AmericanAir Its not that I wasn\\'t offered \"perks\" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, \"NO.\" #thenewamerican @AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir @AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn\\'t even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take @AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you\\'re flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them @AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you\\'re delayed @AmericanAir continues to win: I\\'ve never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh. @AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You\\'ll never touch my pets again. @AmericanAir don\\'t worry you won\\'t steal my money again @AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?! @AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa @AmericanAir \\nIt\\'s not what happens to us that matters...It\\'s our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA. @AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned. @AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven\\'t been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams @AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_- @AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today! @AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight? @AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What\\'s going on? @AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings @AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice @AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy. @AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow. @AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that? @AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff @AmericanAir I\\'m not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place. @AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks! @AmericanAir I\\'d like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems. @AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary. @AmericanAir that doesn\\'t really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification... @AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system. @AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in @AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta @AmericanAir I\\'m frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican @AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service @AmericanAir You\\'ve misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, \"NO.\" @AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait @AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out @AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good @AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it\\'s well past that. @AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight. @AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn\\'t care @AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir @AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me? @AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour. @AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I\\'m now out of extra meds and diapers for baby. @AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency @AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical @AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE! @AmericanAir Fuck you. @AmericanAir \\nNot giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it\\'s return, please???????? @americanair Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend @AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase @AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest. @AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn\\'t involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours? @AmericanAir the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444 @AmericanAir 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and... @AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out. @AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern @AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous. @AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after @AmericanAir since you don\\'t care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept @AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire @AmericanAir It\\'s been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks @AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don\\'t have a seat assignment? Seriously? @AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!! @AmericanAir why does it feel like I\\'m being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat @AmericanAir Flight 2559 it\\'s been delayed every hour since 8:55 am. @AmericanAir Can\\'t unload flight #3322 because jetway is broken.  #steps #planB? #waiting nearly an hour @AmericanAir I\\'d love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb @AmericanAir just look at RDU airport. please think about the safety of your passengers. we cant get to RDU safely!\\n\\nhttp://t.co/wDyEkVB1Ze @AmericanAir Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight? @AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I\\'ll reconsider my future flight options. @AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska 😒 @AmericanAir I need an answer why we can\\'t get into Wichita Falls. @AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM @AmericanAir I need refund. @AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS @AmericanAir why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory??? @AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found @AmericanAir and it\\'s not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It\\'s A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay @AmericanAir stop sending me back to \"customer relations \"I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!! @AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day @AmericanAir \\nCan you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks @AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW? @AmericanAir Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate w/companies forU! @AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can\\'t help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh @AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length. @AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks. @AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK @AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation? @AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL @AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats @AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO. @AmericanAir guess that\\'s what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don\\'t have other options JS @AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman @AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn\\'t had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength “@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?” @AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no? @AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another??? @AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937 @AmericanAir \\nHello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this? @AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can\\'t find a tool to service the shock absorber. @AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should’ve taken diff route or airline I suppose! @AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I\\'m betting this will go 6 mths @AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle @AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance? @AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home. @AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we’re told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don’t. @AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI @AmericanAir Well I\\'m showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed? @AmericanAir My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can\\'t fix it? @AmericanAir Is it possible to change the FF number on a passenger on a Flight Booking Problems, it won\\'t let me change it? @AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for \"rampers\" #AA4285 @AmericanAir Just got a call from baggage dept. \"...still looking for your property\". It\\'s went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!! @AmericanAir there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom @AmericanAir what\\'s the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I\\'m getting different reports? @AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land. @AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams. @AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!! @AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx @AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on... @AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance? @AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. \"We will take off soon.\" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW. @AmericanAir I\\'ll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service. @AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible. @AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn\\'t help me. @AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can\\'t use &amp; can\\'t change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2 @AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight! @AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print @AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland @AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn\\'t leaving till 1220 @AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do? @AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating. @AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I\\'m hungry! Get me to DFW! @AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight. @AmericanAir when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft.. @AmericanAir don\\'t merge with an airline that ain\\'t ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee “@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We\\'ll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset @AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci @AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated @AmericanAir @USAirways #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 @flyLAXairport. No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!! @AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying! @AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff. @AmericanAir I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to? @AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC @AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I\\'ve flown almost all of them @AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love! @AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm @AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better. @AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane @AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that\\'s why I\\'m bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer. @AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside. @AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts \"why this person was talking to her\". @AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU @AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still \"Now Boarding\"... @AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I\\'m not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site. @AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform. @AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated. @AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i\\'m on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that @AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding. @AmericanAir 140 characters aren\\'t enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are @AmericanAir your cabin \\'thank you\\' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time. @AmericanAir really? That\\'s it? Not even a \"we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time\" @AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401 @AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don\\'t have time to do that. #terrible @AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people @AmericanAir having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline\\'s website will allow seat selection? @AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance. @AmericanAir I fly weekly with you and haven\\'t seen one @AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it\\'s not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll @AmericanAir Uwon\\'t allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service? @AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction. @AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn\\'t help at all. @AmericanAir That’s a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101. @AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful? @AmericanAir If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using \"weather\" @AmericanAir she has  the guy u served drinks 2  til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women @AmericanAir there\\'s a lot of talks and no doing. \\nMIA-SFO on a 20+ year old plane #nonewplanes #old #shame http://t.co/TwETPXUpPN @AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future ! @AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you! @AmericanAir especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks @AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space. @AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what? @AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! @AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull! @AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn\\'t done like it was promised it would yesterday @AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should\\'ve bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning @AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you. @AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges? @AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline. @AmericanAir I\\'m flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭 @AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can\\'t do...... @AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can\\'t file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg @AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA\\'s response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!! @AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes.... @AmericanAir is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur @AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care @AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt @AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy @AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from... @AmericanAir it isn\\'t good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline @AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I\\'m still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX @AmericanAir what\\'s the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone @AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in. @AmericanAir would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep. @AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues @AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not? @AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt @AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances. @AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow @AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter. @AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead. @AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd .@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue. .@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded... @AmericanAir I\\'m trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error @AmericanAir Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... http://t.co/DQnn0Rf1V8 @AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling. @AmericanAir I\\'ve been trying to change a Thursday flight and there\\'s a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn\\'t helping @AmericanAir We all did! Skipper\\'s walk-around too :( @AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn\\'t work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system. @AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply. @AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen?? @AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information @AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled! @AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I\\'ve emailed your customer service twice now who don\\'t seem to care. @AmericanAir no I\\'ve since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost! @AmericanAir nothing, you have done enough. @AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection! @AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!! @AmericanAir I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or @abc7newsBayArea please help! @AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you\\'re supposed to provide @AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I\\'m done with you. @AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You\\'re terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX @AmericanAir I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no @AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should @AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere @AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp. @AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation @AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer @AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude 😡😡 @AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry @AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible.. @AmericanAir I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company \"doesn\\'t issue refunds for phone bills\" help!phone will be shut off @AmericanAir TY! But, their site says \" Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ...\" @AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them @AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to\"arrange pick up\"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won\\'t reimburse me. Help! @AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine. @AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don\\'t like myself? @AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line @AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service @AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around @AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain @AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible @AmericanAir that\\'s absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can\\'t immediately call back when disconnected??? @AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they\\'d call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!! @AmericanAir *does = doesn\\'t @AmericanAir Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It\\'s a very small item. @AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service! @AmericanAir @emxlyy \"The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear.\" @AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available??? @AmericanAir I\\'ll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ❤️ these earrings!! @AmericanAir checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas.  Baggage was only checked to ORD. @AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks @AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour. @AmericanAir I understand that but I\\'m hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag. @AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow @AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation. @AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be. @AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help? @AmericanAir I DM\\'d you Why doesn\\'t @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever @AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event @AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing. @AmericanAir it\\'s not only my bag...it\\'s the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag @AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time. Why doesn\\'t @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever @AmericanAir  it\\'s not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. 👎😡✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm @AmericanAir no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday... @AmericanAir Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let\\'s try this again!! @AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage. @AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that\\'s supposed to be going to Okc. There\\'s an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer? @AmericanAir - thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice @AmericanAir they responded. I can\\'t respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever @AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain @AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight? .@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I\\'d rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks! @AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I\\'ve bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back @AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm. @AmericanAir couldn\\'t get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won\\'t be on flt 1568 tomorrow. @AmericanAir @united @SpiritAirPR  @Fioretti2ndWard @ChicagosMayor @garcia4chicago BS that #Noise #Late Flight #NoRahm http://t.co/CFzdJmn0uI @AmericanAir It\\'s sad how I can\\'t afford any long distance trips though. :/ @djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience @AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I\\'m a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath. @AmericanAir it\\'s beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing. @AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this @AmericanAir - you broke my sick wife\\'s luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice @AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting now to be connected to an agent @AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations @AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn\\'t. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day @AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario @AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH 😁 @AmericanAir your online site doesn\\'t have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done? @AmericanAir #2298. Everyone else  was outstanding. @AmericanAir the last was 2339 dfw to ord. Not weather reLate Flightd... Austin leg delayed as well @AmericanAir My bag flew with AA while I flew with Delta, and I\\'m still not sure whose final carrier is referred to. @AmericanAir you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets @americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Mon http://t.co/Q37pOWn6uv @Cowboycerrone figures right? @AmericanAir you know I love this airline, but why are my friends @MEGENTRIPODI @jordnnicole7 having such a problem retaining info they need @AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah \"I\" got it rebooked @AmericanAir you\\'ve got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I\\'m hoping it\\'s on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much @AmericanAir You\\'re clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I\\'d have missed funeral. Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper \"she\\'s still at the hotel, she probably doesn\\'t think she has to work until tomorrow\" @AmericanAir I\\'m at the airport right now and your people didn\\'t know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated. @AmericanAir So break whatever you want, take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew @chicagotribune @WSJ #nytimes @CNN @americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Monday, Flightaware says. http://t.co/atwyiFh6Zy @AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn\\'t the reason they wouldn\\'t change it. Y\\'all literally said that you\\'d rather have an empty seat. @AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK @AmericanAir Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail @AmericanAir now on 5th plane of the day. First 4 all taken out of svc. Scheduled dep 3 p.m. Still on ground ORD 10:45pm @AmericanAir you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse @AmericanAir even followed me, but I still can\\'t get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer \"service\". Ever. #customerservice #fail @AmericanAir yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke @AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why? @AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear @AmericanAir 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8 @AmericanAir It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ? @AmericanAir I booked it on US Airways site. Don\\'t see a Cancelled Flight link :( @AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty @AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical @AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I\\'ll stick the Delta from now on. @AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can\\'t even deliver it after I was told it would happen. @AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable @AmericanAir what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot . @AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere. @AmericanAir which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days @AmericanAir Nope. Couldn\\'t make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed. @AmericanAir doesn\\'t care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can\\'t do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew @AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again. @AmericanAir Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. http://t.co/I7Vdi9WqSF @AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm @AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable. @AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still. @AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child. @AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I\\'ve ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke @AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather @AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will @AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth @AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient @AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight @AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have @AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn\\'t work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment. @AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won\\'t let me select online and there\\'s a fee... @AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen. @AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys @AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won\\'t bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn\\'t nicer. Terrible service @AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i\\'m deaf and been on hold so long? @AmericanAir \"sorry you were disappointed\" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs @AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It\\'s not allowing me to book available seats @AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids. @AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail @AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they\\'d rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW @AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern @AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don\\'t think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help @AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting @AmericanAir If it\\'s in my backpack, why do I need to see agent? @AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice @AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u. @AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn\\'t been released to inv. Help? @AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight @AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money? @AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help! @AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn\\'t even try to help! @AmericanAir the issue wasn\\'t a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn\\'t let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message. @AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami @AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys. @AmericanAir I\\'m here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy @AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag. @AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry @AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I\\'m not. I\\'ve been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous @AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting @AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH @AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn\\'t get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: @krescate We don\\'t like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us.\" @AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty @AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money @AmericanAir im still on hold... @AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It\\'s because your airline sucks. @AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?! @AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal. @AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL. @AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort.. @AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service @AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money? @AmericanAir why do you continually play the \"according to federal regulations\" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service... @AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport????? @AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService @AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this? .@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action. @AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem @AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it @AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I\\'m disappointed. @AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience @AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you\\'ll give me a free upgrade to first. @AmericanAir I didn\\'t want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530 @AmericanAir it\\'s not about the delay.  It\\'s about the communication. @AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service? @AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central. @AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted @AmericanAir @USAirways - I\\'m pregnant with twins and you\\'re going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it\\'s your fault? @AmericanAir has no idea what they\\'re doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME. @AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back. @AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don\\'t you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call @AmericanAir I can\\'t work with them if the call gets cut off while I\\'m still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow? @AmericanAir u didn\\'t give an answer why the flight delayed so long. and how do u compensate missing my other flights Lima to Cuzco?? @AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you @AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee\\'s swapping your customers belongings? @AmericanAir now I have to wait \"more than 60 minutes\" @AmericanAir I need assistance reFlight Booking Problems a flight from dfw to lit @AmericanAir Just took off. Sitting with someone who is scheduled on Buenos ares out of JFK,not sre if he will make it. R thy holding plane? .@AmericanAir No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported @AmericanAir my Mistake multibillion dollar company @AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn\\'t been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this? @AmericanAir for our delays !!! I\\'m out of more money because of you @AmericanAir I have got a flight for\\nThe next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit @AmericanAir dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints.

We can\\'t mail\\nThem\\nA payment and fly before hand right @AmericanAir No. It does. You could not be more wrong. http://t.co/66NXZhBbMT @AmericanAir Why doesn\\'t anyone make a better effort to retain customers. It should be an easy fix, I just want to travel AA. @AmericanAir btr trained gate agts. Im a frequent flyer &amp; have nvr had issue w/my bag 2day I was forced 2 gate check while priority boarding @AmericanAir misplaced my bag 36 hr ago and can\\'t tell me where it is.

Never again @AmericanAir improve Envoy\\'s performance.  5th trip through ORD in 2015 I\\'ve been delayed for hours because of Envoy.  I could drive faster! @AmericanAir two Cancelled Flightled LGA flights. Both by @Delta took off. Looks like I have a new carrier @Delta! @AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight? @AmericanAir Really?They closed the gate at 10:30 instead of40.I got there at 10:39. If u wudda put in my ktn like I asked, I wudda made it. @AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can\\'t get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please? @AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open.

Will try diff airline for work trips @AmericanAir I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven\\'t received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come? @AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA @AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can\\'t get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer. @AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks! @AmericanAir you\\'re airline is ridiculous @AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service! @AmericanAir that\\'s the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed. @AmericanAir My flight 1389 from Las Vegas to DFW was Cancelled Flightled! I\\'ve been on hold forever and I still have not spoken to anyone! Pls Help @AmericanAir every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up. @AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans 👀 @AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably @AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes @AmericanAir overbooked business class from Mia to uvf - after being in the correct seat we were moved back to economy on our special day @AmericanAir that\\'s unacceptable @AmericanAir so what if I didn\\'t have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral @AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I\\'m suree you guys don\\'t care @AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it\\'s costing more for delays oh and did I mention @AmericanAir I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn\\'t a problem. @AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble @AmericanAir for my delay and you know what I get a we don\\'t credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking @AmericanAir a free check bag a food comp a flying credit something to help out now that I\\'m an additional 200 dollars in the hole @AmericanAir yes I did but no response. @AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW @AmericanAir I\\'d just like to know where my bag is, when I\\'ll get it and why I don\\'t have it already. No accountability from Cust Service. @AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything @AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days @AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH @AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag! @AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help! @AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week. @AmericanAir It\\'s not about weather, it\\'s logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents? @AmericanAir I\\'ve never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers. @AmericanAir Also Agent not aware clearly of http://t.co/FWKJ49B1LE @AmericanAir Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice @AmericanAir I fly American because of family but severe weather excuse so I can\\'t call to make change, why have a computer if u cant modify @AmericanAir No Meelan did not afford a supervisor to be included in the conversation, pls check the rec of the call #badcustomerservice @AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because \"severe weather\" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each. @AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can\\'t go to funerals or see friends bc of it. @AmericanAir what\\'s done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over. @AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately. @AmericanAir why can\\'t @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?! @AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning. @AmericanAir already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall @AmericanAir but seriously if my cats dead I\\'m going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul @AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr! @AmericanAir @USAirways I\\'ve tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that @AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it... @AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn\\'t received anything but after @AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate! @AmericanAir cannot understand how you are part of oneworld all other member treat their customers fairly #tcf #oldplanes #damageluggage @AmericanAir probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it! @AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting! @AmericanAir thanks! I hope we get movies. Tv\\'s were broke on the flight over @AmericanAir thanks for being entirely unhelpful and wasting hours of my time today Well @AmericanAir we won\\'t be flying you. Rebooked on Jetblue. With credits (that actually work) it was free! @AmericanAir check on what? Our broken tablet! See attached picture. #media #filmcrew #nbc #cnn http://t.co/Uq2ooPjPwg @AmericanAir been calling all morning. Still can\\'t get through. I need to chge a flight that is this week!!!!! @AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m @AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying \" delays happen\".. Uh huh.. @AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don\\'t see any way to do that from my reservations page. @AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated @AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight @AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane. @AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing. @AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane @AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho? @AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating @AmericanAir I understand they\\'re busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk @AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left! @AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it. @AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model. @AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS. @AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume @AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out. @AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight @AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn\\'t be bothered. @AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz? @AmericanAir I\\'ve been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up? @AmericanAir thanks - I miss my dog and this delay is costing me a lot of money. @AmericanAir I still can\\'t get through to change my flight.

There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days. @AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had. @AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I\\'ve ever seen.

Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y? @AmericanAir there\\'s an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn\\'t fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291 @AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That\\'s BS too.. @AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?! @AmericanAir Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes! @AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren\\'t available @AmericanAir I paid using Paypal online and after I was charged there was a \"System Error\" which is what I ended up calling about. @AmericanAir that\\'s why I\\'m asking for exception. Staffer moving last minute,we\\'re a nonprofit &amp; losing $400,we just want to change ticket. @AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I\\'ve been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent! @AmericanAir yes there\\'s issues on the site as well unfortunately. @AmericanAir my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning. @AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think? @americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don\\'t answer, #hardtodo @AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I\\'m stuck @AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized @AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful. @AmericanAir Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG! @AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic @AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to \"weather\", while other flights were still landing at DFW @AmericanAir your a LIAR, no precipitation all day, 47 degrees, don\\'t pacify, you look like a fool.......thats the problem, admit you suck @AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever @AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I\\'m sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters! @AmericanAir What\\'s with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes. .@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now @AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I\\'m not paying extra to select a seat. @AmericanAir why can\\'t you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it\\'s customers? @AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day @AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn\\'t make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant @AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again...... @AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ @AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now. @AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied! @AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby. @AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes? @AmericanAir need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can\\'t travel http://t.co/gVgKHbx1RB @AmericanAir I\\'m trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim @AmericanAir hi there flight from Dallas just Cancelled Flightled going to LA. Can u pls help rebook me? @AmericanAir 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn\\'t said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain @AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on. @AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice? @AmericanAir I don\\'t believe it\\'s acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that\\'s standard. @AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn\\'t allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address? @AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call? @AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r @AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail @AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn\\'t the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS @AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I\\'d be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation. @AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice @AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5 @AmericanAir We don\\'t mind the fee! We were told we can\\'t change name on ticket at all. @AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn\\'t reflect the use of a voucher @AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren\\'t able to accommodate. Thank you. @AmericanAir After being patient about my \"delayed\" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable! @AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service. @AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night @AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive) @AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn\\'t put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline. @AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I\\'d have to take a 2nd day off work. @AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said \"we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch\"! @AmericanAir, I\\'ve tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I\\'m having no luck -help! @AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour. @AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday. @AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice @AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows. @AmericanAir unacceptable. It\\'s clear losing just one customer doesn\\'t matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take @AmericanAir will do on another airline that\\'s more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply @AmericanAir is there a way to reserve my dog’s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline! @AmericanAir I\\'ve been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler! @americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD @AmericanAir it\\'s GTSVYB. It says it\\'s Cancelled Flightled when I try to check. @AmericanAir That\\'s good, I\\'d expect that but I can\\'t get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online? @AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions. @AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the \"flyers right\\'s booklet\" @AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can\\'t be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday. @AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where\\'smybag @AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You\\'re ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage. @AmericanAir but don\\'t you worry... @Delta took good care of me... Your loss, their gain. @AmericanAir sure is. What\\'s more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands. @AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn\\'t. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam! @AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry @AmericanAir Your people on the phone can\\'t see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That\\'s a poor process then... @AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob @AmericanAir not helpful @AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt @AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b @AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I\\'m not patient.  Why don\\'t you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold @AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess. @AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling @AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would\\'ve been better! #WakingInMemphis @AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up! @americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it. @AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl @AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn\\'t able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line. @AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM. @AmericanAir \"bag has not yet been located\". Again, 5th time I\\'ve checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system? @AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!! @AmericanAir @maxfitgirl29 next time fly Southwest... @AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck. @AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be @AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox. @AmericanAir get me outta here @americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up… @AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions @AmericanAir don\\'t they already know ?  Isn\\'t everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It\\'s not even close to decent. @AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don\\'t see it @AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don\\'t make us pay huge fee to change flight. @AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport @AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr @AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers @AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn\\'t Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day. @AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn\\'t know you had a major staff shortage ?? @AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day. @AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP! @AmericanAir You don\\'t care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn\\'t care about my sister @AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us. @AmericanAir, that\\'s not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too @AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr.. @AmericanAir 249 EWR - DFW is now stopping BNA to refuel 4 bad weather? Are YOU just trying to get the plane closer 2 DFW then Cancelled Flight on us? @AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it\\'s no longer available. @AmericanAir now you\\'re sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain @AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service. @AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true @AmericanAir There was no one from #AA at the #woase2015 event @HelsinkiAirport\\nLots of info available of #winterops @AmericanAir you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight! @AmericanAir been calling for over 24hrs now and getting no where but told to call back by the automated system is extremely frustrating @AmericanAir just sad that even after spending so much on tickets all I wanted was for my wife to still go with her sister and no help @AmericanAir @USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to. @AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected @AmericanAir your team rebooked my Cancelled Flightled AA flight on a different airline. New airline has no such Flight Booking Problems. Flight is this evening. @AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous @AmericanAir I don\\'t like making a scene but this hasn\\'t been addressed properly. Please have them do that. @AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here . @AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me.

How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage @AmericanAir really @AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me? @AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing. @AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can\\'t get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24. @AmericanAir @EdPlotts don\\'t bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply @AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit. @americanair 30 minutes since landing - flight 1531 from Miami and no luggage- what\\'s the delay @AmericanAir got it, so it\\'s just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again. @AmericanAir Define \"sincerely\". Your actions do not reflect what you\\'re saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media. @AmericanAir follows the Talent PM of #BDSM porn site http://t.co/UQGW6qsFFU. New \"Economy Dungeon\" class coming? http://t.co/pl9Sop5IHu @AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service. @AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn\\'t take 6 weeks to reply to an email. @AmericanAir I\\'m trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don\\'t see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation? @AmericanAir 45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on @AmericanAir my flight 1337 is Cancelled Flightled.  Can you let me know what my new flight info is? @AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB @AmericanAir My flight through Dallas was Cancelled Flightled and I talked to reservations agent and got a new flight but have not received an email @AmericanAir #last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I\\'d pay more to fly @Delta @AmericanAir - I\\'d be happy to hold on the phone, but your phone system is not allowing that and simply hangs up. @AmericanAir Trying desperately to rebook my moms flight. Waited 10 hours for callback, got disconnected and they didn’t call back. #help @AmericanAir Thanks but don\\'t understand why they couldn\\'t have used the tug at the next gate over, ground crew took a break? #unacceptable @AmericanAir That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now??? @AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outraged😡😡 @AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min @AmericanAir No! We departed 24 hours Late Flightr, with a crazy crew. One of the lady simply freaked out and got away from job before departure. @AmericanAir Don\\'t require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options @AmericanAir 2 months and still no exec platinum member cards. What gives? @AmericanAir For the love of all that is holy, if your automated phone system is going to give like 8 options, give numerical shortcuts @AmericanAir you can tweet but not call! You\\'re like a bad boyfriend! @AmericanAir @British_Airways trying to speak with an agent about my flight to London tonight but can\\'t get anyone from AA.  Can you help? @AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn\\'t require accountability @AmericanAir I\\'ve been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again. @AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink @AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren\\'t working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help @AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help @AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service. @AmericanAir We\\'ve 15 official complaints signed by #AmericanAirlines Lima supervisor. Customer Relations pls compensate 4 the 10-hour delay @AmericanAir I need to rebook and I cannot get an agent.

How about some actual help? @AmericanAir because your plane\\'s toilet wasn\\'t working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some... @AmericanAir you\\'re not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn\\'t get us home - and we\\'re at ORD @AmericanAir boarded flight 2334 at 8:30am.

I\\'ve come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again @americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off? @AmericanAir I was flying today to MTY Mex at 9:30am but still appear Cancelled Flight, Where can i talk for another flight? @AmericanAir You didn\\'t call, did you.

Own up to your Mistakes. @AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in @AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag @AmericanAir no vouchers 4 Cancelled Flighted flight due 2 weather. Today\\'s issue, broken tire. No vouchers cause tire was broken by weather. #nomoAA @AmericanAir worst airline!

Repair wait at gate - Capt Said \"paperwork formality\"- forced to check bag rudely-returning CC reader doesn\\'t work @AmericanAir One hour to check in is 45 minutes too long. MIA FAIL. @AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel @AmericanAir I can\\'t get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got. @AmericanAir She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn\\'t offer me the price I\\'d tried to purchase it at. @AmericanAir @USAirways \"ma\\'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk\" {sees line ~45 people deep} @AmericanAir @united we\\'ll have time and they aren\\'t doing a damn thing. I\\'m the guy in the winter hat and frowny face @AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff @AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O\\'Hare gate K13. Why don\\'t you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows... @AmericanAir I DM\\'d you.

What is the normal response time? @AmericanAir the flight I\\'m trying to change is in 4 hours and I\\'ve been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. @AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional @AmericanAir SJC-&gt;LAX. After the fourth time, I gave up! @AmericanAir my flight to San Angelo via Dallas from Orlando Cancelled Flighted help! On hold and disconnect @AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide? @AmericanAir your staff at JFK airport are discussing the way we we\\'re left stranded @AmericanAir Can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? It\\'s not letting me add it online.... @AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys! @AmericanAir confused at the definition of a \"preferred seat.\" I paid extra for one and got a regular seat with no legroom. Unimpressed. @AmericanAir Howdy, having trouble getting rebooked after flight Cancelled Flightled. Can\\'t get thru via phone and Web erroring out. Can you help? @AmericanAir Oh yea? That\\'s it? C\\'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL @AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights. @AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous @AmericanAir I dmed @AmericanAir don\\'t see response! @AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME! @AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can\\'t even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation! @AmericanAir @united You\\'re both equally terrible, and I\\'m going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated @AmericanAir @united wrote back saying \\'it\\'s been a challenging week...that\\'s for sure\" - no shit. @AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru @AmericanAir @united week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to... @AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn\\'t address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane @AmericanAir @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It\\'s really a shame that you think telling me \"it\\'s been a challenging\" @AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last @AmericanAir @united getting us to where we need to be. This is not acceptable. Not to mention, Cancelled Flighting meetings/interviews for my client @AmericanAir between your airline and @united I\\'ve now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars... @AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I\\'ve been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now. @AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me... @AmericanAir what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O\\'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a... @AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help @AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can\\'t book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold @AmericanAir I tried already and I am on the waiting list for a call back #2hourwaitsucks @AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes @AmericanAir as of now, will do my best to never fly w/ #AmericanAirlines ever again. Y\\'all have made this a day to remember. @AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it\\'s the skycap that finds a solution @AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway. @AmericanAir what response? Is our flight out of Montrose Cancelled Flightled or not? @AmericanAir thanks for the DM rescheduling. Unfortunately your operations process at LAX is chaos &amp; the reps refused to print the ticket @AmericanAir Cancelled Flighting my flight today because of weather in Dallas without being charged? @AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven\\'t gotten one yet. @AmericanAir Please try it yourself - call 1-800-433-7300 and see what happens... then you\\'ll understand.  #allrepresentativesbusy #nooption @AmericanAir I tried to check in, but they redirect me to call in to @USAirways, which I also can\\'t get into contact with @AmericanAir flight delayed 3 times today due to flight officer. 4333 from pit to ord. 5 hour delay to date. #bademployeeproblem? @AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can\\'t. @AmericanAir yes but not with much help from you guys @AmericanAir Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can\\'t access anything regarding international travel on your website-- @AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven\\'t heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information! @AmericanAir My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that\\'s not possible with the phone issues at #americanair @AmericanAir the app doesn\\'t allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger. @AmericanAir You are having phone issues.  Please fix it!!!! @AmericanAir I can\\'t!!!  No one can\\'t get to \"hold\".  You can\\'t get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED @AmericanAir trying to get home is beyond complicated. It\\'s should not be this hard. Students are split up and we will not fly AA ever again @AmericanAir is your website down?

Just sayin\\' that was a particularly poorly handled situation. @AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was \"no longer available\" just because it wouldn\\'t accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC @AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety? @AmericanAir can you? @AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can\\'t get through. @AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don\\'t care about their safety? @AmericanAir I\\'ve been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable @AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you? @AmericanAir you\\'re almost as bad as @united @AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N @AmericanAir there is two hour wait @AmericanAir can\\'t get thru to anyone on phone @AmericanAir  when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning?

Online and calling not helping with this busy day @AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: \"can I have some water?\" \"no we don\\'t do that. please take your seat\" @AmericanAir The website won\\'t let me view my reservation due to \"changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY\". I\\'m on hold now to get help. @AmericanAir @USAirways outbound flight: 2 hour delay b/c air traffic &amp; 2 gate changes dividend miles member gets no email or text updates @AmericanAir record locator oaaret got email we couldn\\'t be rebooked but got no notification flight was Cancelled Flightled @AmericanAir it\\'s not a friend it\\'s a legally required chaperone on a school trip. @AmericanAir @RLDelahunty record l#oaaret got email we couldn\\'t get rescheduled on another flight but don\\'t know if flight is Cancelled Flightled @AmericanAir it\\'s more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone \\nRes. on hold and can\\'t get thru to use a credit to pay for it @AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I\\'m rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv @AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold @AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help @AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch @AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs @AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time! @AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I\\'d wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out. @AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we\\'re stuck changing a tire @AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me @AmericanAir BRING MY FIANCÉ @meerikangas BACK TO ME! @AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here\\'s to another night at the airport!! @AmericanAir but you\\'re not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right? @AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs @AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today. @AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke @AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP! @AmericanAir It\\'s our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted @AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA. @AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can\\'t reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours @AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I\\'m attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund? @AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do? @AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to \"weather\" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent. @AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn\\'t pick up status on US Air flight. @AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way! @AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution @AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take \"18 hours\" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is \"the best we can\" @AmericanAir it\\'s not about the weather. It\\'s about the fact that I can\\'t get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back. @AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can\\'t get through to anyone. @AmericanAir I\\'ve witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude @AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails? @AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that\\'s not helpful. @AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice @AmericanAir I\\'ve tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX. @AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don\\'t understand why those whose bags couldn\\'t fit aren\\'t notified in air/at landing #technology @AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!! @AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers @AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I\\'ve been waiting a week @AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can\\'t hang my suit up because I didn\\'t buy first class? @Delta when will I learn @AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don\\'t send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.\\nDirect email? @AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I\\'ve ever seen from a  ✈️ brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe @AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love... @AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed. @AmericanAir I understand that, but I\\'m not even being put on hold - it says \"try again Late Flightr, goodbye\". @AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner. @AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you\\'d like to know it\\'s not working well. I received three calls but there\\'s no audio. @AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow! @AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details. @AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up. @AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won\\'t have the uncomfortable convo w pass. @AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven\\'t heard anything yet. @AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?! @AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me? @AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative. @AmericanAir I don\\'t know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing. @AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off @AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options? @AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I\\'m having to sleep at the airport again tonight. @AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn\\'t worked. .@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I\\'ve been trying since last night to get through. @AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers \"we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai\" and then hanging up is not the best practice. @AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don\\'t have ANY feedback as a reward @AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer @AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don\\'t give to the passengers any certain information @AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt! @AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can\\'t keep calling. @AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn\\'t take this long to reroute. You\\'re Customer Service lacks @AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate. @AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying. @AmericanAir Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst @AmericanAir I can\\'t get an operator after an hour\\'s worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn\\'t go beyond message. @AmericanAir cannot provide us alternative flight until 36 hours Late Flightr ruining our trip! #Cancelled Flightled #angry #problems #ruined. @AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane? @AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications. @AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic . @AmericanAir now you change my gate and don\\'t tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people.

I need to be rebooked, and I can\\'t do it online and they aren\\'t answering calls. Help! @AmericanAir I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response.

I went 0 for 2 yesterday. @AmericanAir I am, called Paris office this morning again, still waiting. It is in Miami but apparently tag was \"taken off\" @AmericanAir Can I get some assistance? Flight Cancelled Flightled (today) from PHX to DFW. Not that I\\'m hating. But my job is concerned @AmericanAir wasn\\'t just a delay. Your counter wouldn\\'t take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass @AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ? @AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I\\'m still waiting for someone to call me back @AmericanAir a confirmed flight.

You won\\'t put @AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave? @AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn\\'t get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that\\'s not cool @AmericanAir Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD @AmericanAir stranded in Miami because your automated system keeps hanging up on me for two days. Help ! @AmericanAir is flight 1318 Cancelled Flighted or not?

Worst airline ever. @AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency?

At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess. @AmericanAir its not that, it\\'s the rude agent who wouldn\\'t listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer @AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral. @AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic @AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me.

I know it\\'s busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer @AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can\\'t do it online #yourphonesystemsucks @AmericanAir we\\'ve been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!! @AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!! @AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of \"weather\" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled @AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice. @AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do? @AmericanAir \"We\\'ll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight\" is ridiculous. @AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning! @vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can\\'t accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny @AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven\\'t strtd boarding. @AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can\\'t reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do? @AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they\\'re not and I continue to be lied to. @AmericanAir won\\'t answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck... @AmericanAir It\\'s not your agents; it\\'s your voice activated system that\\'s not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems @AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won\\'t be better for flight 750. thanks @AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg @AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don\\'t see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines @AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven\\'t even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet @AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid @AmericanAir So plot thickens. We\\'re on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers.... @AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can\\'t talk to humans. @AmericanAir what happened?? We didn\\'t get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone @AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn\\'t  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ? @AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help? @AmericanAir aa223 being ignored @AmericanAir FYI twice now I\\'ve tried the \"we\\'ll call you when someone is free\" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up. @AmericanAir that\\'s the number I called -it wouldn\\'t let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today @AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can\\'t figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F @AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time @AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed. @AmericanAir I didn\\'t miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault. @AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines @AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand @AmericanAir I\\'ve never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline. @AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife\\'s flight and she has to call but your service won\\'t even let us. Going on 7 hours now. @AmericanAir it shouldn\\'t happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items @AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence. @AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet. @AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we\\'ll have heard from an AA rep at that point. @AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting @AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food @AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳 @americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF @AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm\\'d you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service. @AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don\\'t like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks. @AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams. @AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance @AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight. @AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose @AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor. @AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293 @AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks. @americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ @AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out @AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293 @AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice @AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It\\'s on us air, so I don\\'t think I\\'ll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks. @AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can\\'t get an agent. They\\'ve called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help? @AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect? @americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight @AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy. @AmericanAir Why can\\'t you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick \"Goodbye\" Very Sad! @AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help! @AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back. @AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives? @AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I\\'m really mad about the situation @AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won\\'t stray anymore. I\\'m talking about you @Delta! @AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer... @AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can\\'t get through on the 800# @AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP @AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight! @AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund? @AmericanAir I can\\'t choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH @AmericanAir it wasn\\'t really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid. @AmericanAir \"overweight\" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let\\'s call it what it is. @AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF? @AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled. @AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I\\'d like to book another flight...I\\'ve been on hold for 95 minutes and counting.... @AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour @AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won\\'t be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning. @AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least. @AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport @AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible! @AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits @AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport @AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing! @AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can\\'t staff a call center Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven\\'t even seen one plane😡 @AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal! @AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on! @AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles. @AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers @AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs @AmericanAir @manuel_c \"here for you\" as in, yeah, we\\'ll tweet platitudes at you so you\\'ll think our Twitter bot cares? Or.... @AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded. @AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I\\'ve ever encountered. Flat out awful @AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don\\'t you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you\\'ve got @AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs @AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue @AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I\\'ve landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this. @AmericanAir delivered mom\\'s delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS @AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won\\'t eat anyway? @AmericanAir this is awful customer service. @AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired @AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don\\'t reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. \\'Cause we don\\'t care. @AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK @AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with @AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally! @AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn\\'t care less. That\\'s why their customer service is run by bots @AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap @AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home! @AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please @AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth @AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded @AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would\\'ve cost me $30 extra per seat. @AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids @AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning! @AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure? @AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook? @AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me? @AmericanAir Close down @AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers\\' bags. @AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again. @AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I\\'ll make sure everyone knows it @AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable. @AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone @AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight @AmericanAir yeah that\\'s not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped. @AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I\\'m missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn\\'t want to talk us @AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out! @AmericanAir I haven\\'t been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven\\'t heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :( @AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting.... @AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it\\'s US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home. @AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days.. @AmericanAir Same as yesterday\\'s Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful! @AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night. @AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles @AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis\\'s flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options? @AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg? @AmericanAir I have not. There\\'s no option for even getting a call back! @AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool. @AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I\\'m stranded at the airport for the night... wow. @AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go? @AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option? @AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day. @AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz. @AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting @AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we\\'re not boarding because we\\'re waiting for catering? @AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight @AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again. @AmericanAir agents refuse to help, \"too busy\" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO @AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck @AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We\\'ve tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united? @AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced. @AmericanAir of course it wasn\\'t your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins @AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help! @AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault @AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call. @AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day @AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel? @AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive @AmericanAir I\\'ve been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me. @AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer. @AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos @AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus @AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I\\'ll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr. @AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX @AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say... @AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 \"Plane not ready\". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed @AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded @AmericanAir why does your customer service line say \"we are experiencing high call volume\" and then spontaneously hangup on the person? @AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people @AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :( @AmericanAir any idea what\\'s up with flight AA3181? @AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes! @AmericanAir sucks!! Teco teco #reclameaqui #TripAdvisor http://t.co/auGJsCmoLu @AmericanAir  You can\\'t get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck @AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don\\'t I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago? @AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home @AmericanAir we\\'re still here guys - you are the worst @AmericanAir 24 hours on the AirPort @AmericanAir - don\\'t understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :( @AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I\\'ve been in YYZ since 5 AM. @AmericanAir plane breaks, unloads the passengers, told to re enter to only come back off.

Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help? @AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel @AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won\\'t give luggage back. Nice. @AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒 @AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone. @AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL. @AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta @AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay @AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport. @AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him \"I understand English.\" His reply?\"Our conversation is over.\" @AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it\\'s winter! staff better @AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc @AmericanAir is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow? @AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.

Sharon was your saviour @AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can\\'t talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume. @AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website? @AmericanAir @dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow.

What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed? @AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography @AmericanAir ...is this how you want to treat your platinum (and two gold) flyers?? @AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish @AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?

Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance. @AmericanAir I\\'ve been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through? @AmericanAir I can\\'t keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue? @AmericanAir I\\'ve called that and they said they can\\'t help me and it\\'s out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer @AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again! @AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA! @AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines @AmericanAir while I\\'m aggravated - shouldn\\'t baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped? @americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure @AmericanAir one of my luggage didn\\'t made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told 😓😭 @AmericanAir lost my wife\\'s luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there. @AmericanAir why don\\'t you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines @AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops. @AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely. @AmericanAir You\\'ve now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go. @AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn\\'t drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines @AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation?

Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears @AmericanAir it\\'s always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst @AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head @AmericanAir 11 out of 11 delayed flights, you suck and getting worse @AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down @AmericanAir @dotnetnate Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight? @AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn\\'t even accepting calls right now - they just hang up. @AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly. @AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it\\'s the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me @AmericanAir even with calls you haven\\'t been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome @AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one @AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn\\'t notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can\\'t get through to an agent. Epic. Fail. @AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she\\'s prob stressed, but I am too! An \"aw, let me help\" cld mk it btr @AmericanAir while I\\'m sensitive to this fact, I don\\'t believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way. @AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff @AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u. @AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing @AmericanAir five times at last count @AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it\\'s suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn\\'t boarded @AmericanAir 250 I\\'m not sure if I\\'m rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:( @AmericanAir Orbitz has only shown \"priority\" seats since we booked &amp; paid 3 weeks ago. @AmericanAir has Cancelled Flighted their last 3 flight into SHV tonight &amp; all flights for tomorrow, Feb. 23, out of SHV and multiple flight into SHV. @AmericanAir this might look good but the pita is inedible. Last year delicious shrimp cocktail. This year garbage http://t.co/Sotl8XQsrp @AmericanAir that\\'s if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer @AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP! @AmericanAir not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet... @AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn\\'t take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir I\\'ve flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst @AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu @AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ? @AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait \"over 2 hours\" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake? @AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful @AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything\\'s gr8 @AmericanAir u cant spell airline and I trusted you to get me home on time and safe you are the worst #gobankrupt http://t.co/aM9CuieWO4 @AmericanAir TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info. @AmericanAir Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP! @AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn\\'t AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around. @AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service. @AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would \"eventually get her bag\" completely unacceptable @AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins @AmericanAir there\\'s a direct from Miami w a seat but u rebooked niece Tuesday. Can\\'t get through on phones? #customerservicefail @AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir. @AmericanAir first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher @AmericanAir I need to change a ticket and my res can\\'t be changed online.  I also can\\'t get a call through due to high volume--can u help? @AmericanAir rented van drove 250 miles with 6 strangers.  Arrived home 6:00am. No offers of help from AA. http://t.co/BTTGmyN0A0 @AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16) @AmericanAir @NY_NJairports Do you guys teach poor customer service or is it just part of an american dream? @AmericanAir 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45.

Have you heard of additional staffing during weather? .@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover. @AmericanAir that\\'s unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves. @AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time. @AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal @AmericanAir LGA 2 Nashville Cancelled Flightled phone center no help. Fabulous staff at gate D4 helped-2 young men handled crowd well. @AmericanAir man we have been sitting in #UA4753 on the tarmac for 30 mins...rescue us please! @AmericanAir please fix your inventory system, Plat upgraded then bumped DOWN after boarding, FA said they made a mistake.

Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times. @AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind. @AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops. @AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through... @AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir.

I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held. @AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It\\'s a small airport, so whatever. @AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies @AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn\\'t work because... @AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys @AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear. .@AmericanAir I can\\'t even get on the phone with your reservations team.

Thanks. @AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I\\'m supposed to be leaving in an hour... .@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I\\'ll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues! @AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket! @AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops. @AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn\\'t your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything? @AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it’s the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather. @AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues? @AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there\\'s only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal. @AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work. @AmericanAir fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don\\'t spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow @AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane.

But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!! @AmericanAir What\\'s the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful. @AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I\\'m an idiot and that is not OK!! I don\\'t need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I\\'ve had @AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin @AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious.

After what you did today to me, you can call me a former customer. @AmericanAir Flight 953 NYC-Buenos Aires has been delay since yesterday at 10PM. Is going to take off at 3.30PM now? Give us answers! @AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can\\'t go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It\\'s my first time in NYC. @AmericanAir How do I change my flight if the phone system keeps telling me that the representatives are busy? @AmericanAir thx for nothing on getting us out of the country and back to US. Broken plane? Come on. Get another one. @AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled, leaving tomorrow morning. Auto rebooked for a Tuesday night flight but need to arrive Monday. @AmericanAir right on cue with the delays👌 @AmericanAir leaving over 20 minutes Late Flight. No warnings or communication until we were 15 minutes Late Flight. That\\'s called shitty customer svc @AmericanAir you have my money, you change my flight, and don\\'t answer your phones! Any other suggestions so I can make my commitment??'"
